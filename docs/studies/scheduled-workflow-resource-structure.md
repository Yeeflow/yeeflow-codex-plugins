# Scheduled Workflow Resource Structure

Source export: `/Users/Renger/Downloads/AI Agent and Copilot Local Resource Baseline8.yap`

Classification: export-proven structure only. No generated scheduled-workflow package, schedule execution, email delivery, or AI execution is runtime-proven in this branch.

## Location

Scheduled Workflow resources are stored in `Data.Forms[]`, not in `Data.Childs[]`.

Observed resource markers:

| Field | Value / pattern |
| --- | --- |
| `WorkflowType` | `3` |
| `ListID` | `0` |
| `ProcModelID` | large numeric workflow/process ID string |
| `Key` | workflow key, such as `AS-WIU` or `AS-DIU` |
| `DefResource` | JSON string containing workflow graph, variables, pageurls, and metadata |
| `Settings` | JSON string containing recurrence schedule |
| `Deployed` | `true` in both studied workflows |

The decoded `DefResource` has the same broad process graph shape as other Yeeflow workflows:

- `childshapes[]` contains `StartNoneEvent`, action nodes, `SequenceFlow`, and `EndNoneEvent`.
- `variables.basic[]`, `variables.listref[]`, and `variables.filter[]` store workflow variable definitions.
- `pageurls[]` exists even for scheduled workflows and contains a lightweight workflow page with `workflowControlPanel` and `workflowHistory`.
- `defkey` matches `Data.Forms[].Key`.
- `workflowType = 3`.
- `AppListSetID` points to the containing application/listset.

## Workflows Found

| Workflow | Key | Schedule | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Weekly information update | `AS-WIU` | weekly, Monday and Wednesday | `MailTask` |
| Daily information update | `AS-DIU` | every 2 working days | `QueryData`, `AI`, `MailTask` |

## Resource Dependencies

The daily workflow references:

- data list `Innovation Ideas` through `QueryData.properties.listid`
- AI Agent `Email generation` through `AI.properties.data.AgentID`
- workflow variables `QueryItems`, `QueryAmount`, `EmailSubject`, and `EmailBody`

## ReplaceIds

The wrapper contained 23 `ReplaceIds`. For generated packages, scheduled workflow process IDs, workflow graph node IDs, page IDs, local list IDs, local field IDs, AI resource IDs, and local app/listset IDs should be considered for fresh generated IDs. Do not remap tenant/user metadata or private recipient values.

## Validation Recommendations

- Treat `WorkflowType = 3` as the Scheduled Workflow discriminator.
- Validate `Settings` parses as JSON and contains `TimeZone`, `Times`, `StartDate`, `Frequency`, and `Interval`.
- Validate `DefResource` parses as JSON and `defkey` matches `Key`.
- Validate `QueryData` targets resolve to included data lists.
- Validate `AI` agent-mode actions resolve to included AI Agent resources.
- Warn on fixed email recipients and block live execution unless recipients are explicitly safe.
