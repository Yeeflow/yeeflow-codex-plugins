# Vendor Onboarding v4.1 Page 1 Dashboard Proof

## Summary

This proof generated Page 1 only for the Vendor Onboarding & Compliance Management application: the Vendor Management Dashboard. It intentionally does not generate the Vendor Detail View Page, New Vendor Request Form, Compliance Review Workspace, or Vendor Print Page.

Primary package:

- `/Users/Renger/Downloads/vendor-onboarding-v41-page1-dashboard.yapk`

YAP fallback:

- `/Users/Renger/Downloads/vendor-onboarding-v41-page1-dashboard.yap`

## Scope

Implemented page:

- Vendor Management Dashboard

Supporting data lists included for dashboard bindings:

- Vendors
- Vendor Documents
- Compliance Reviews
- Vendor Activity / History

The package uses AppID `41`, API-issued generated IDs, current dashboard Type `103`, and dashboard `Ext2` with `{"src":true}`. YAPK `PortalInfo` is `null`.

## Dashboard Sections Implemented

The dashboard was generated from the v4 composition checklist page `vendor_management_dashboard` and implements all eight required Page 1 sections:

| Section | Template | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Header/action area | `dashboard_header_action_bar` | Implemented |
| KPI card row | `kpi_card_row` | Implemented |
| Onboarding completion progress section | `progress_summary_card` | Implemented |
| Urgent compliance alert | `business_alert_card` | Implemented |
| Onboarding status board | `kanban_status_board` | Implemented |
| Vendors Data table | `data_table_section` | Implemented |
| Quick links | `quick_links_icon_list` | Implemented |
| Recent activity timeline | `recent_activity_timeline` | Implemented |

## Major Controls

Implemented controls include:

- Padded root dashboard canvas.
- Header/action area with meaningful title, context, and navigation buttons.
- Four KPI card containers: Total Vendors, Pending Onboarding, High Risk Vendors, Expiring Documents.
- Progress circle and progress bar.
- Business-specific compliance alert, replacing default alert text.
- Onboarding status Kanban board with dynamic item fields and local item actions.
- Vendors Data table with configured `Field` and `FieldName` columns.
- Quick links icon list.
- Recent activity timeline with dynamic fields.

## Import-Failure Fix

The first Page 1 generated files failed product import/install:

- YAPK install failed with `The package you uploaded is incorrect, please check and try again.`
- YAP import failed with `Created failed`.

The root causes were package-shape issues:

- YAPK decoded `AppPackageInfo` contained generator-only list/layout keys and null values that failed the stricter product schema.
- YAPK wrapper `AppID` was emitted as a string rather than the schema-compatible integer.
- YAP `Data` payload preserved 19-digit IDs as JSON strings instead of raw JSON integer tokens, which failed the product-team YAP import-rule validator.
- Generated field storage names used a `Title`/per-type counter pattern instead of the proven global index pattern such as `Text0`, `Decimal11`, and `DateTime14`.

The regenerated files now use export-like YAPK list/layout/field metadata, raw large integer tokens in the YAP `Data` string, product-clean field storage names, `PortalInfo: null` for YAPK, and `SimplePortal: null` inside the YAP decoded resource.

## Validation Results

YAPK package validation:

- Command: `node validate-yapk-package.js /Users/Renger/Downloads/vendor-onboarding-v41-page1-dashboard.yapk`
- Result: pass
- Errors: 0
- Warnings: 1 non-blocking runtime-proof reminder

YAPK schema v2 validation:

- Command: `node scripts/inspect-yapk-schema-standard.mjs /Users/Renger/Downloads/vendor-onboarding-v41-page1-dashboard.yapk`
- Result: pass

YAPK strict product schema validation:

- Command: `node scripts/validate-standard-package-schema.mjs /Users/Renger/Downloads/vendor-onboarding-v41-page1-dashboard.yapk`
- Result: pass
- Errors: 0

YAP product-team schema/import-rule validation:

- Command: `node scripts/inspect-yap-schema-standard.mjs /Users/Renger/Downloads/vendor-onboarding-v41-page1-dashboard.yap`
- Result: pass
- Errors: 0
- Large numeric IDs preserved: 43

Strict visual quality and composition checklist:

- Command: `node scripts/inspect-generated-app-quality.mjs --package /Users/Renger/Downloads/vendor-onboarding-v41-page1-dashboard.yapk --spec docs/generated-app-plans/vendor-onboarding-compliance-ui-implementation-spec.md --composition-checklist docs/generated-app-plans/vendor-onboarding-v4-composition-checklist.normalized.json --template-library docs/templates/yeeflow-ui-section-template-library.normalized.json --strict-visual-app-quality --checklist-page vendor_management_dashboard`
- Result: pass with warnings
- Errors: 0
- Warnings: 3 non-blocking spec-document warnings
- Template conformance: 8 checked, 8 passed, 0 failed

Generated UI quality:

- Command: `node scripts/inspect-generated-ui-quality.mjs /Users/Renger/Downloads/vendor-onboarding-v41-page1-dashboard.yapk`
- Result: pass
- Errors: 0
- Warnings: 0

Optional YAP fallback:

- The fallback file was regenerated after the initial `Created failed` import result.
- It now passes the product-team YAP schema/import-rule validator and the scoped visual/template quality check.
- Runtime import success still needs manual confirmation.

## Proof Boundary

This is a local generation and validation proof for a dashboard-only YAPK. It proves:

- The YAPK package was generated.
- The wrapper and resource decode validations pass.
- The dashboard uses the current `src` dashboard marker.
- The dashboard satisfies the Page 1 composition checklist and template conformance gates.
- The dashboard-specific visual quality gate passes with no blocking errors.

This proof does not prove:

- Runtime install/open review in Yeeflow.
- Visual fidelity for Pages 2 through 5.
- Full application generation.
- YAP fallback import success.
- Runtime install/import success for either regenerated package.

## Manual Test Checklist

- Install `/Users/Renger/Downloads/vendor-onboarding-v41-page1-dashboard.yapk`.
- Confirm the application opens with only the intended Page 1 dashboard plus supporting data lists.
- Open Vendor Management Dashboard.
- Verify the dashboard uses the current dashboard renderer, not the retired legacy renderer.
- Confirm page padding, card boundaries, section spacing, and multi-column layout look materially stronger than v3/v4.
- Confirm KPI cards render as real card-like sections.
- Confirm the compliance alert shows business-specific copy, not default alert text.
- Confirm the Onboarding Status Board renders meaningful vendor card fields.
- Confirm the Vendors Data table shows configured columns and no deleted-field error.
- Confirm Quick Links and Recent Activity sections are present.
- Record runtime visual gaps before starting Page 2 generation.
