# Workflow Actions: Approval Form vs Data List

## Purpose

This study compares export-proven Start action and Assignment Task action shapes between approval form workflows, data-list workflows, and the later quick Scheduled Workflow export study.

Source exports:

- Approval workflow baseline: `/Users/Renger/Downloads/Test ABC.yap`
- Approval workflow extended settings: `/Users/Renger/Downloads/Test ABC (1).yap`, `/Users/Renger/Downloads/Test ABC (2).yap`, `/Users/Renger/Downloads/Test ABC (3).yap`
- Data-list workflow: `/Users/Renger/Downloads/Purchase Requests.ydl`
- Scheduled workflow comparison: `/Users/Renger/Downloads/Workflow Actions Runtime Baseline (1).yap`

The data-list export was decoded read-only. Raw `.ydl`, decoded payloads, private IDs, user names, email addresses, tenant IDs, and raw response data are not committed.

## Generation Rules

- Keep approval form workflow and data-list workflow Start action rules separate.
- For data-list workflow Start actions, do not invent `terminate`, `terminate-conditions`, or `revoke-conditions` unless a data-list export proves them.
- Preserve Start email notification fields together when present: `isenabledemail`, `to`, `subject`, and `html`.
- Preserve data-list workflow `FlowMappings[]` trigger settings and workflow `ListID`/`WorkflowType` linkage.
- Preserve Assignment Task assignee list values as expression-button strings; do not convert list-item expressions into static IDs.
- For Created By assignee routing, preserve the list-item `CreatedBy` source and selected property, such as `LineManager`, as export-proven.
- Do not invent user, group, position, department, location, list, or field IDs. Use safe lookup or explicit tenant-local mapping only when authorized.
- Preserve data-list task form list controls with `isListControl: true`, `identifier`, `InternalName`, `fieldID`, and `____customListFields_` binding.
- Set custom list fields read-only when the task should display source data without updating it.
- Treat default/native list field editability as export-proven only for the fields observed here; runtime/designer proof is still needed before broad claims.
- Lay out generated workflow nodes without overlap and keep sequence-flow source/target plus incoming/outgoing references consistent.

## Validator Recommendations

- Warn, not hard-error in compatibility mode, when a data-list workflow task form list-field control references an unknown field.
- Warn when a list-field binding does not use the studied `____customListFields_` prefix.
- Warn when a native/default list field is explicitly editable; studied native/default examples were read-only.
- Warn when a custom list field is editable unless generation explicitly wants the task to update that source field.
- Warn that list-item assignee expressions are export-proven but runtime routing still needs a focused baseline.

## Runtime-Test Additions

Future focused runtime baselines should add data-list workflow designer/open proof for:

- data-list Start action email notification configuration
- Assignment Task assignee from Created By/list item context
- data-list task form list-bound controls
- read-only custom list fields
- default/native list fields in task forms

Runtime submit/routing proof should use disposable list records and safe assignee references only. Do not test email delivery unless safe recipients and delivery scope are explicitly approved.

## Combined Baseline Coverage

`generate-workflow-actions-combined-runtime-baseline.mjs` builds a single ignored package with one approval form and one data list so the two workflow families can be checked in one Yeeflow app:

- approval-form workflow: Start terminate/recall/email fields plus representative Assignment Task assignee, task type, appointed order, due-date, reminder, and notification settings
- data-list workflow: Start email settings without terminate/recall fields, Created By/list-field assignee expression, and a task form with list-bound controls

The combined package is for import/open/designer/publish proof first. It should not be used to claim routing, email delivery, due-date reminder delivery, or data-list task form save behavior until those paths are explicitly submitted and observed with safe test data.

The combined package was imported and tested in Chrome. The approval workflow designer opened with a non-overlapping graph, the approval Start panel rendered terminate/recall/condition/email settings, representative Assignment Task panels rendered assignee/task-type/appointed-order controls, and the approval workflow published successfully. After read-only API-assisted safety checks confirmed the first approval Assignment Task was a single direct-user target, one fake approval request was submitted and a new Pending task appeared for `Workflow Action Approval Test` with task label `Static User Assignment`. This submit proof is limited to the first approval direct-user task.

The data-list workflow designer opened with a Start -> Assignment Task -> End graph, rendered data-list Start email settings without terminate/recall controls, rendered the data-list Assignment Task mixed assignee/list-field expression configuration, and published successfully. Data-list item submission was skipped because the first data-list Assignment Task has mixed direct, expression, user-group, and list-item/Created By sources. Data-list routing, group/position/list-field expansion, task-form save/edit behavior, due-date reminders, and email delivery were not tested.

## Known Gaps

- Data-list Start terminate/recall fields were not found in this export.
- Data-list Start email delivery was not tested.
- Created By/list-field assignee routing was not runtime-tested.
- Approval direct static-user routing is runtime-proven only for the first submitted task in the combined baseline.
- Data-list task form save/edit behavior for list-bound controls was not runtime-tested.
- Default/native list field read-only behavior is based only on the studied export shape.

## Scheduled Workflow Addendum

`Workflow Actions Runtime Baseline (1).yap` adds one Scheduled Workflow comparison point. See `docs/studies/workflow-scheduled-vs-approval-data-list-actions.md` for the focused study.

| Capability | Approval form workflow | Data-list workflow | Scheduled workflow | Proof level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Workflow discriminator | `WorkflowType = 2` | `WorkflowType = 1` | `WorkflowType = 3`, `ListID = 0` | export-proven |
| Start node | `StartNoneEvent` | `StartNoneEvent` | `StartNoneEvent` | export-proven |
| Start terminate/recall | present in approval export | absent in data-list export | absent in scheduled export | export-proven |
| Start email config | present | present | present | product-documented + export-proven |
| Assignment Task family | `MultiAssignmentTask` | `MultiAssignmentTask` | `MultiAssignmentTask` | export-proven + validator-backed |
| Scheduled assignee source | approval/applicant context | list-item context available in data-list export | applicant line-manager expression only in scheduled export | export-proven |
| Data-list field expression source | not found | found | not found in scheduled export | export-proven |

Generation rule: do not copy approval-form terminate/recall fields or data-list field assignee sources into Scheduled Workflow generation unless a Scheduled Workflow export proves those fields. Scheduled Workflow Assignment Task routing remains untested.
