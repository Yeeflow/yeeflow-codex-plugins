# Application Planning Capability Coverage

This study audits whether recent Yeeflow platform learning is visible during application planning, before package generation starts. It is a planning-coverage milestone: it does not add new package validation behavior, generate a baseline package, or claim new runtime proof.

## Planning Rule

Every full Yeeflow application build plan should include a `Capability Coverage Plan` before implementation. The plan should choose the capabilities that belong in v1, explicitly exclude capabilities that are irrelevant, mark partially proven or unproven capabilities honestly, assign each selected capability to the responsible skill, and define validation plus runtime-test boundaries.

The planning phase should avoid both under-planning and feature stuffing. A capability is considered when it is relevant to the business process, not automatically included in every app.

## Coverage Matrix

## Capability Coverage Plan Template

Every full app plan should include:

```text
Capability Coverage Plan

Selected capabilities:
- <capability>: <why it is needed in v1, responsible skill, proof target>

Intentionally excluded capabilities:
- <capability>: <why it is not relevant or is better deferred>

Deferred or unproven capabilities:
- <capability>: <proof gap, fallback, required learning/runtime test>

Runtime test boundary:
- Import/open:
- Resource rendering:
- Workflow/AI/email/external execution:
- Deferred execution:

Safety boundary:
- Private data:
- Credentials/tokens:
- Generated packages/artifacts:
- Human review requirements:

Skill and validator dependencies:
- <skill/validator/doc>: <use>
```

## Planning Self-Check

Before generating a package, Codex should confirm:

- the plan considered the current learned capability set without forcing irrelevant features into the app
- every selected capability has a responsible specialized skill or documented generator rule
- unproven, partial, or runtime-sensitive capabilities are marked honestly
- validation commands and runtime proof boundaries are named before build/runtime test
- no generated plan depends on real users, tenant IDs, emails, credentials, tokens, private documents, image binaries, raw exports, decoded payloads, or generated package artifacts being committed
