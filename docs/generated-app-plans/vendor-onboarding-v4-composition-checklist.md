# Vendor Onboarding v4 Implementation Composition Checklist

## Purpose

This checklist is a pre-generation contract for the next Vendor Onboarding & Compliance Management package. Do not generate a YAP or YAPK package until this checklist is reviewed and approved.

The v4 package must implement the approved UI implementation spec and the five approved mockup pages as a complete, usable Yeeflow application, not as an importable scaffold. Every item below must be either implemented or explicitly deferred with a reason, fallback, and validation impact.

Approved spec: `docs/generated-app-plans/vendor-onboarding-compliance-ui-implementation-spec.md`

Approved mockup pages:

1. Vendor Management Dashboard
2. Vendor Detail View Page
3. New Vendor Request Form
4. Compliance Review Workspace
5. Vendor Print Page

Machine-readable validator input: `docs/generated-app-plans/vendor-onboarding-v4-composition-checklist.normalized.json`

## Global Pre-Generation Gates

- [ ] The composition checklist is reviewed and approved before package generation starts.
- [ ] No YAP/YAPK package is generated during checklist preparation.
- [ ] The generator has a page-by-page control map before emitting package JSON.
- [ ] Every planned page has a section-by-section validation rule.
- [ ] Every data-bound control lists its source list and displayed fields.
- [ ] Every Data table column includes `Field` as the source internal field name and `FieldName` as the visible label.
- [ ] Every dashboard uses the current Type 103 dashboard shell with `Ext2` containing `{"src":true}`.
- [ ] No legacy dashboard shell is allowed.
- [ ] No no-portal YAP uses `SimplePortal: {}` or `SimplePortal: []`; no-portal YAP must use `SimplePortal: null`.
- [ ] No no-portal YAPK uses `PortalInfo: {}` or `PortalInfo: []`; no-portal YAPK must use `PortalInfo: null`.
- [ ] All generated IDs except `AppID` come from the Yeeflow generate-unique-ids API and preserve 19-digit IDs without JavaScript rounding.
- [ ] `AppID` remains fixed at `41`.
- [ ] Buttons are only active when they have a valid action binding, navigation target, or form action.
- [ ] Placeholder or deferred actions are rendered as text/status notes, not active buttons.
- [ ] Alerts use business-specific content and never use default text such as `Alert` or `Here is the description`.
- [ ] Kanban and Collection item templates include dynamic business fields and valid item actions or an explicit no-action reason.
- [ ] Custom forms and print pages are designed, padded, sectioned, and non-blank.
- [ ] The generated package must pass strict visual app quality after generation; import success alone is not success.
