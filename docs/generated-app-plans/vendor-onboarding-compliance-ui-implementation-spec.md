# Vendor Onboarding & Compliance Management UI Implementation Spec

## Design Reference

- Source: five thread-generated UI mockups for Vendor Onboarding & Compliance Management.
- Mockup pages:
  - Vendor Management Dashboard
  - Vendor Detail View Page
  - New Vendor Request Form
  - Compliance Review Workspace
  - Vendor Print Page
- Scope: convert the visual design intent into a Yeeflow-native implementation plan. Do not generate the `.yap` or `.yapk` package from this spec until the spec is reviewed and approved.
- Privacy note: the mockup image files are not committed. This spec uses only tenant-neutral placeholders and does not include API keys, tenant IDs, private URLs, raw package payloads, screenshots, decoded `Resource` or `Sign` values, or generated runtime packages.

## Application Overview

### Business Goal

Vendor Onboarding & Compliance Management helps procurement, legal, finance, and compliance teams manage the full vendor lifecycle from request intake through document collection, risk review, approval, contract setup, activation, renewal tracking, and ongoing compliance monitoring.

### Target Users

- Requester / Business Owner: submits new vendor requests and tracks onboarding progress.
- Procurement Manager: reviews vendor details, owns onboarding coordination, and manages operational follow-up.
- Compliance Officer: reviews risk level, certifications, insurance, sanctions results, and required compliance actions.
- Legal Reviewer: reviews contract documents, legal terms, and contract status.
- Finance Reviewer: reviews tax details, bank/payment information, payment terms, budget category, and spend estimate.
- Vendor Management Admin: configures and monitors vendor records, documents, task queues, renewals, and status dashboards.

### Core Process

1. A requester submits a new vendor onboarding request.
2. Procurement reviews vendor profile details and document completeness.
3. Compliance reviews risk level, insurance, certifications, sanctions screening, and required actions.
4. Legal reviews contract documents and terms.
5. Finance reviews payment terms, tax documents, bank information, budget category, and annual spend estimate.
6. Once all required reviews pass, the vendor becomes active.
7. The application tracks renewal dates, expiring documents, open tasks, recent activity, and compliance risk.

### Implementation Scope

Build a full Yeeflow application from this spec, not a simple MVP, unless the user explicitly requests a smaller proof package. The first generated package should include the planned data lists, dashboard, detail view, request form, compliance workspace, print page, actions, workflows, and validation gates described below.

No live API call is required to generate the package. If runtime proof is requested later, use tenant-neutral configuration guidance and local `.env.local` values without committing credentials.

- Remove Document Row: sub-list row action, only for optional rows where safe.

Workflow needs:

- On submit, create default Vendor Tasks for Procurement, Compliance, Legal, and Finance when appropriate.
- On submit, create Vendor Activity / History row.
- Optional workflow creates required Vendor Documents rows if Dynamic Sub List is not persisted directly.

Style settings:

- Form background neutral, section cards white.
- 24px card padding, 16px control spacing, clear labels.
- Required fields should be visually marked.
- Footer buttons align right on desktop and stack on mobile if needed.

Custom CSS needs:

- Scoped CSS for form section card spacing, sticky footer action bar if supported, and sub-list table readability.

Custom code needs:

- Bulk actions must use selected IDs/count variables and validate all action bindings.
- High-risk or expired-document actions may create Vendor Tasks for follow-up.

Style settings:

- Operational layout, not decorative: dense but readable.
- Main Kanban has consistent lane widths and card spacing.
- Detail panel uses white card with badge row.
- Alert uses red/orange only for true risk.
- Bulk toolbar appears only when selected count is greater than zero if dynamic display rules are supported.

Custom CSS needs:

- Scoped CSS for fixed or scrollable Kanban/table layout, selected-card state, bulk toolbar spacing, and risk badges.

Custom code needs:

- None required for default workspace. Use Custom code only if a complex split-pane selected-record interaction cannot be represented with standard dashboard variables/actions and Collection/Kanban controls.

Validation checks:

- Minimal borders and dividers.
- Clear typographic hierarchy.
- Compact table rows.
- Avoid heavy shadows in print mode.
- Keep status badges print-readable in grayscale.

Custom CSS needs:

- Scoped print CSS for page margins, table row borders, section page-break handling, hiding non-print controls, and readable status badges.

Custom code needs:

- None required. Use Custom code only if a tenant requires specialized print rendering beyond Print Page plus scoped CSS.

Validation checks:

- Print Page exists for Vendors.
- Print layout uses safe readable spacing and print-specific CSS.
- Document checklist has configured columns.
- Timeline has meaningful date/title/actor fields.

## UI/UX and Yeeflow Control Mapping

| Visual UI Pattern | Yeeflow Implementation | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| KPI cards | Container/Grid/Text/Dynamic fields | Use calculated or filtered counts where supported; otherwise display safe summary fields. |
| Progress circle | Progress circle | Use onboarding completion or risk score percentage. |
| Progress bar | Progress bar | Use onboarding completion on detail view. |
| Alert boxes | Alert | Use for urgent compliance risks, missing documents, expired documents, or required document notice. |
| Kanban boards | Kanban | Group by Onboarding Status, Risk Level, or Compliance Status. Item templates must include meaningful fields. |

| Steps | Steps bar | Use onboarding process stages and print approval timeline summary. |
| Dynamic fields/users/files | Dynamic controls | Use Dynamic field, Dynamic user, Dynamic file/image where related display is needed. |
| Document preview | Document embed | Use on Documents tab; ensure attachment binding resolves. |
| Required document line items | Dynamic Sub List | Use on New Vendor Request Form for document checklist and file attachments where supported. |
| Task/review cards | Collection | Use for Compliance Reviews and Vendor Tasks with action buttons. |
| Bulk toolbar | Collection/Kanban actions plus dashboard variables | Track selected IDs/count; validate all bindings and dynamic visibility. |
| Print layout | Data List Print Page plus custom CSS | Use read-only fields, compact tables, dividers, and print-specific styles. |
| QR Code | QR Code | Bind to safe record URL or Vendor Code placeholder; avoid tenant-specific hardcoding. |
| Barcode | Barcode | Bind to Vendor Code. |
| Custom polish | Scoped custom CSS | Use for card spacing, status badges, print formatting, and responsive layout refinements. |
| Custom UI gaps | Custom code only if needed | Use only when standard controls plus CSS cannot meet a real requirement. |

## Design Quality Rules

- Every dashboard, view form, edit form, and print page must use a safe outer page container.
- Recommended padding:
  - desktop: 24px to 32px left/right.
  - tablet: 20px to 24px left/right.
  - mobile: 16px left/right.
- Do not place major controls directly against the page/window edge.
- Use section/card containers for major content groups.
- Use 16px to 24px grid gaps for dashboard and form sections.
- Use readable card internals: title, primary dynamic value, secondary context, status badge, and action area where needed.
- Use professional blue/teal accents for primary actions and progress.
- Use clear status colors consistently across all pages.
- Every Data table must define:
  - data source.
  - at least 3 to 5 meaningful display columns.
  - a primary title/name field when available.
  - status/date/owner/risk/spend fields where relevant.
- Collection, Kanban, and Timeline templates must include meaningful dynamic fields and must not be empty.
- Buttons/actions must bind to valid form, page, collection, or workflow actions.
- Dynamic fields must resolve to the selected data source or current item context.
- Print page must remain readable without interactive affordances.
- Custom CSS must be scoped, minimal, documented, and must not hide broken structure.
- Custom code is not part of the default plan and should only be added after standard controls and CSS are insufficient.

  - create activity entry.
- Review status workflows:
  - update Compliance Status.
  - update Onboarding Status when review milestones complete.
  - create activity entries.
- Document expiry/renewal workflow:
  - detect expiring documents or upcoming renewal dates.
  - create tasks or alerts.
- Optional approval workflow:
  - route Procurement, Compliance, Legal, and Finance review tasks if the package target is an Approval Form workflow rather than a Data List workflow.

### Validation Gates

- `scripts/inspect-generated-app-quality.mjs --package <package> --spec docs/generated-app-plans/vendor-onboarding-compliance-ui-implementation-spec.md`
- Package validator for generated `.yap` or `.yapk` content.
- Import-readiness inspector.
- UI quality inspector.
- Collection/Kanban action inspector when item/bulk actions are generated.
- Dashboard/data-list/form padding and table-column checks.
- Safety scan for `.env.local`, secrets, raw packages, decoded payloads, raw `Resource`, raw `Sign`, API responses, private URLs, private IDs, and screenshots/images.

### Visual Consistency Checklist

- Each mockup page has a corresponding Yeeflow page, form, dashboard, or print page.
- Each major visible section exists in the generated package.
- Every dashboard and form has safe outer padding.
- Card/grid structure is present.
- All Data tables have configured columns.
- Kanban and Collection templates have meaningful dynamic fields.
- Timeline templates have date/title/actor/type fields.
- Document embed resolves to a file/attachment binding.
- Dynamic Sub List exists for required document line items.
- Bulk toolbar uses selected IDs/count variables and valid actions.
- QR Code and Barcode are safe and configured.
- Print Page uses print-oriented layout and scoped CSS.
- No empty or unconfigured controls remain.
- No unresolved fields, data sources, layouts, actions, or workflow references remain.

## Custom CSS and Custom Code Boundary

Custom CSS is expected for visual polish:

- KPI card spacing and subtle card style.
- Status badges for risk/status fields.
- Kanban/Collection card spacing.
- Dashboard responsive grid spacing.
- Compliance workspace bulk toolbar.
- Print page margins, dividers, table borders, and page-break behavior.

Custom code is not required for the first implementation. Consider Custom code only if a later approved requirement cannot be implemented with Yeeflow standard controls, standard actions, expressions, dashboard variables, and scoped CSS.

## Proof Boundary

This spec is a design-to-implementation planning artifact. It does not prove that a generated package imports, opens, renders, or behaves correctly at runtime.

Expected proof path after review:

1. Generate the full YAPK package from this spec.
2. Validate the package locally against this spec.
3. Run package, graph, import-readiness, UI quality, action-binding, and safety validators.
4. Import into a safe Yeeflow test environment.
5. Runtime-test:
   - dashboard open/render.
   - detail view tabs.
   - new vendor form render.
   - compliance workspace render.
   - print page render.
   - table columns.
   - Kanban/Collection templates.
   - document checklist bindings.
   - non-destructive actions.
6. Only promote runtime claims for behaviors actually tested.
