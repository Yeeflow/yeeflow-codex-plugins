# Custom Code Template Library Study

Source: `Custom Code templates.zip` extracted read-only to a temporary working folder.

This study inventories all 13 Yeeflow custom code templates before app generation. Runtime support is claimed only where already proven by prior Smart Lookup Picker testing. Public form support remains untested and is not claimed for any template.

## Summary

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| activity-timeline | Dashboard / analytics | Show record events, changes, comments, and operational actions in chronological order. | dashboard, approvalForm, dataListForm | Read-only | none | Inventory-only. Runtime rendering is not proven for this template. |
| approval-decision-panel | Approval / workflow experience | Capture or display reviewer decision and comments in an approval context. | approvalForm | Interactive | none | Inventory-only. Needs focused approval-task runtime proof before relying on decision writeback. |
| approval-timeline | Approval / workflow experience | Show approval history, actors, timestamps, decisions, and comments. | approvalForm, dataListForm | Read-only | none | Inventory-only. Runtime rendering against generated approval-history records is not proven. |

Public form is not tested. |
| trend-chart-module | Dashboard / analytics | Render time-based list trends by day, week, or month. | dashboard | Read-only | none | Inventory-only. Needs dashboard runtime proof with dated records. |

## Functional Classification

### Dashboard / analytics

- `kpi-card-set`
- `distribution-chart-module`
- `trend-chart-module`
- `exception-alert-panel`
- `related-record-summary-grid`
- `activity-timeline`

### Approval / workflow experience

- `approval-decision-panel`
- `approval-timeline`

### Data entry / picker / selection

- `smart-lookup-picker`
- `dependent-selector`
- `hierarchical-selector`
- `multi-entry-tag-input`
- `checklist-compliance-block`

## Export-Backed Custom Code Control Baseline

- Script source is embedded in `attrs["codein-script"]`.
- Input parameters are stored in `attrs["codein-script-param"]`.
- Dashboard writable outputs use `__temp_` targets.
- Approval form writable outputs use `__variables_` targets.
- Data-list custom form writable outputs use `__list_` targets.
- Public forms require separate export/runtime proof before generation claims.

## Source Of Truth

- Source-code `inputParameters()` is the parameter-schema source of truth.
- User guides and example configs are setup guidance and should be checked against source code.
- Smart Lookup Picker export/runtime baselines are the only current source of runtime support claims.
- For the other 12 templates, this study is inventory evidence, not runtime proof.
