# Employee Family Implant v3 Generated Baseline

Generated: 2026-05-17 23:55:00

## Package

- App definition: `employee-family-implant-app-def.v3.json`
- Approval form definition: `employee-family-implant-approval-form-def.v3.json`
- Runtime report: `employee-family-implant-runtime-test-report.v3.json`
- Wrapper package: `employee-family-implant.v3.yap` after wrapper build
- FlowKey: `EJX`
- ID family: `653...`
- App-packaged form ListID: `0`

## Baseline preserved

V3 preserves the accepted v1/v2 requester/applicant behavior, readonly applicant snapshot, product sublist lookup/autofill, row subtotal, total amount, family quota check, prior usage aggregation, over-quota guard, usage create/update/release, HR Review, Finance/Benefits Review, return/resubmission, no duplicate usage on resubmission, and Implant Applications / Family Quota Usage persistence.

## V3 additions

- Advanced Home and HR Operations dashboard surfaces implemented with real Summary controls, chart controls, and data-bound queue/report tables.
- Export-ready views for applications, department/status/applicant reporting, custom package requests, return/resubmission, attachment exceptions, expiry exceptions, released/rejected usage, quota adjustments, and finance review history.
- Active Workflow Routing Rules list with hybrid configuration guidance.
- Manager Review status/configuration fields with fallback-to-HR behavior because dynamic requester line-manager assignment remains runtime-unproven.
- Expiry fields and HR exception monitoring for returned/rejected requests using a 30-day policy model; no fake scheduler is generated.
- Scenario-driven attachment rules and HR verification enforcement.
- Family Quota Adjustments list and approved adjustment query/sum path.
- Employee Reference fallback list for profile missing / HR verification cases.
- Finance Review History list for export-ready finance audit.
- Additional audit/lifecycle fields on Implant Applications.

## Runtime limitations to verify

- Requester-based profile expressions.
- Identity picker change event refresh.
- Family Quota Adjustment query/sum inclusion.
- Workflow ContentList edit paths for usage approval/release/return.
- Return/resubmission outcome behavior.
- Dynamic scheduler and dynamic manager assignment are not claimed as implemented; v3 uses documented safe fallbacks.
- Dashboard charts require representative source records during runtime validation. Empty charts are no-data states; only a chart model-load failure after valid source data exists should be treated as a chart defect.

## Validation status

Local validation passes with existing warnings recorded in `employee-family-implant-runtime-test-report.v3.json`.

Dashboard structure inspection confirms:

- Home: 4 Summary controls, 2 data-list controls, 4 dashboard `exts`.
- HR Operations Dashboard: 12 Summary controls, 2 pie charts, 2 column charts, 1 line chart, 8 data-list controls, 17 dashboard `exts`.
- Wrapper `ReportIds`: 21.
- Hardcoded fake KPI text values: 0 found.

Runtime chart learning has been corrected: the user added representative source data and confirmed pie, column, and monthly trend chart sections render/load with data. Empty charts are now classified as a no-data / insufficient-seed-data result, not a chart-model failure.

This document does not claim the complete v3 final runtime baseline. Full v1/v2 regression and all v3 workflow paths still need to be rerun before final baseline acceptance.
