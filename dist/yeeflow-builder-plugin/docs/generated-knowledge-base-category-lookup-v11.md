# Generated Knowledge Base Category Lookup v11

Package: `knowledge-base-category-lookup-v11.yap`

Download copy: `<downloads>/Knowledge Base Category Lookup v11.yap`

Status: validation passed and runtime import/open/list smoke tests passed with one refresh required on the first Articles list load.

## What It Proves

This package is the first runtime-proven Knowledge Base lookup isolation after the safe v4 plain text category-label baseline.

It proves:

- local `Categories` list can add `Decimal1` as `Order`
- local `Articles` list can keep `Text4` as a plain input slot
- local `Articles` list can add `Text3` as `Category Lookup`
- lookup can target local generated `Categories.Title`
- lookup can sort by target `Categories.Decimal1`
- Home dashboard Collections still render with plain category labels
- Categories and Articles list pages can open
- the new-item lookup dropdown resolves local category rows in sort order

## Runtime Evidence

Imported app was remapped by Yeeflow to:

`#/list-set/41/2054546520105824257/2054546526046138369`

Verified:

- app tile appeared as `Knowledge Base Category Lookup v11`
- Home dashboard opened and rendered article/category Collection cards
- `Categories` opened with three sample rows and visible `Order` values
- `Articles` initially showed a loading spinner, then opened after one browser refresh
- `Articles` showed Article Title, Category Label, and Category Lookup columns
- new-item form displayed `Category Lookup`
- Category Lookup dropdown resolved options sorted by Order: Getting Started, Operations, Application Builder

No record was saved during the new-item lookup check.

## Generator Rules Learned

- Keep v4 as the safest first Knowledge Base package.
- Use v11 only when lookup is explicitly part of the package being tested.
- Add `Categories.Decimal1` as `Order` with number step/min rules before using it as lookup sort metadata.
- Keep `Articles.Text4` as a plain input slot when using the v11 lookup shape.
- Add `Articles.Text3` as `Category Lookup`.
- Set lookup rules:
  - `appid`: `41`
  - `listid`: generated Categories list ID
  - `listsetid`: generated root listset ID
  - `listfield`: `Title`
  - `displayStyle`: `dropdown`
  - `sort-first.SortName`: `Decimal1`
  - `sort-first.SortByDesc`: `false`
- Keep article lookup sample values blank until a later package proves local target sample row IDs can be imported and displayed safely.
- If Articles shows a spinner on first open, refresh once before classifying runtime failure.

## Validation Results

Passed:

- `node --check generate-knowledge-base-category-lookup-v11.mjs`
- `node validate-yap-package.js knowledge-base-category-lookup-v11-resource.json --mode generator --stage final`
- `node validate-yap-graph.js knowledge-base-category-lookup-v11-resource.json --mode generator --stage final`
- `node build-yap-wrapper.js knowledge-base-category-lookup-v11-resource.json knowledge-base-category-lookup-v11.yap --title "Knowledge Base Category Lookup v11" --description "..."`
- `node validate-yap-package.js knowledge-base-category-lookup-v11.yap --mode generator --stage final`
- `node validate-yap-graph.js knowledge-base-category-lookup-v11.yap --mode generator --stage final`

Only package warning: `APP_THEME_EMPTY`.

## Known Gaps

- Lookup sample values are blank; local target row ID values still need a separate fresh-ID package.
- Articles first load may require one refresh.
- The source template's exact `Text4` lookup shape is still not safe by itself; v11 proves the user-updated `Text3` lookup with `Text4` plain slot pattern instead.
