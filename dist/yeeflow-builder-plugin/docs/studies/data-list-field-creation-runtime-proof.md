# Data List Field Creation Runtime Proof

## Scope

This focused runtime baseline validates a generated Data List package after the Data List / Document Library field-type learning milestone. It proves import/open/field-creation behavior for a representative Data List subset only. It does not exhaustively test all 27 export-proven field types, does not test Document Library custom fields, and does not test Form Report.

## Package

- Generator: `generate-data-list-field-creation-runtime-proof.mjs`
- Local package: `data-list-field-creation-runtime-proof.v1.yap`
- Import copy: `<downloads>/data-list-field-creation-runtime-proof.v1.yap`
- App: `Data List Field Creation Runtime Proof`
- Runtime site: `https://codex.yeeflow.com/`

Generated resources:

- `Field Creation Runtime Test`
- `Lookup Source Runtime Test`

Representative field subset:

| Field type | Included field | Runtime proof level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input` | Runtime Record Name | import/open/visible |
| `textarea` | Runtime Notes | import/open, not grid-visible because textarea grid column remains unproven |
| `input_number` | Runtime Quantity | import/open/visible |
| `currency` | Runtime Budget | import/open/visible |
| `percent` | Runtime Completion Percent | import/open/visible |
| `switch` | Runtime Approved Flag | import/open/visible |
| `checkbox` | Runtime Choice | import/open/visible |
| `datepicker` | Runtime Due Date | import/open/visible |
| `time` | Runtime Due Time | import/open/visible |
| `identity-picker` | Runtime Owner | import/open/visible |
| `organization-picker` | Runtime Department | import/open/visible |
| `file-upload` | Runtime Attachment | import/open/visible |
| `icon-upload` | Runtime Image | import/open/visible |
| `lookup` | Runtime Lookup | import/open/schema-validated; lookup value resolution not tested |
| `calculated-column` | Runtime Total Estimate | import/open/schema-validated; formula runtime correctness not tested |
| `list` | Runtime Sub List | import/open/schema-validated; nested data-entry behavior not tested |

Metadata fields were intentionally omitted from this runtime package because stable tenant/category taxonomy values were not safe to generate without a focused reference.

## Local Validation

All local validation was run against `data-list-field-creation-runtime-proof.v1.yap`.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Generator syntax check | pass |
| `scripts/inspect-data-list-fields.mjs` | pass, 0 errors, 0 warnings |
| `scripts/inspect-app-creation-rules.mjs` | pass, 0 errors, 0 warnings |
| `validate-yap-package.js --mode generator --stage final` | pass with warnings, 0 errors |
| `validate-yap-graph.js --mode generator --stage final` | pass with warnings, 0 errors |

The package preserves the v0.5.12 app-creation gates: `FieldIndex` / `FieldName` suffix synchronization, unique `DisplayName`, `FieldName`, and `InternalName`, valid `InternalName`, and valid local lookup references.

Warnings are retained for runtime-sensitive field families such as percent, checkbox, time, identity/organization pickers, upload fields, calculated columns, and sub-lists.

## Runtime Result

Runtime import/open/field-creation proof was completed in Yeeflow.

| Step | Result | Proof label |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Import package | Succeeded | runtime-import-proven |
| Open app | Succeeded as `Data List Field Creation Runtime Proof` | runtime-open-proven |
| Open `Field Creation Runtime Test` | Succeeded | data-list-open-proven |
| Confirm representative columns | Visible columns included record name, number, currency, percent, switch, checkbox, date, time, user, department, attachment, and image fields | field-visibility-proven for visible subset |
| Open `+ New column` | Succeeded | field-creation-panel-proven |
| Save additional single-line field | Saved `Runtime Extra Field` | data-list-field-creation-proven |
| Duplicate-value error | Did not appear | runtime-regression-not-observed |

Yeeflow displayed `Added Successfully` after saving `Runtime Extra Field`.

## Proof Boundary

Runtime-proven:

- Generated package imports.
- App opens.
- Data List resource opens.
- Representative Data List columns render visibly for the focused subset listed above.
- A new single-line field can be added after import.
- The previous duplicate-value error associated with `FieldIndex` / `FieldName` mismatch did not appear.

Validator-backed:

- Lookup field references a generated local source list and source field.
- Calculated column references generated earlier numeric fields.
- Sub-list nested variables are structurally valid and unique.

Not runtime-proven:

- Exhaustive runtime behavior for all 27 export-proven field types.
- Record data-entry behavior for the generated fields.
- Lookup value resolution.
- Calculated formula result correctness.
- Attachment upload behavior.
- Image upload behavior.
- User/department picker selection behavior.
- Sub-list row data entry.
- Metadata or multiple metadata generation.
- Document Library custom-field behavior.
- Workflow behavior.
- Form Report behavior.

## Next Step

Review and merge this branch, then decide whether to run a second focused runtime proof for the higher-risk advanced fields that were intentionally not exercised here, especially metadata, multiple metadata, lookup runtime value resolution, calculated result correctness, and sub-list row entry.
