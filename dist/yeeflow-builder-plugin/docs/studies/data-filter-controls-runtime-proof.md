# Dashboard Data Filter Controls Runtime Proof

## Scope

- Branch: `codex/data-filter-controls-runtime-proof`
- Generated package: `data-filter-controls-runtime-proof.v1.yap`
- Downloads copy: `<downloads>/data-filter-controls-runtime-proof.v1.yap`
- App: `Data Filter Runtime Proof`
- Dashboard: `Dashboard`
- Runtime tenant: `https://codex.yeeflow.com/`

This is a focused runtime proof for a generated dashboard package. It does not attempt exhaustive behavior coverage for all 12 Data Filter controls or every operator/value shape.

## Package Shape

The generated package uses synthetic event-planning rows and a small dashboard with:

- Search filter bound to `filter_Search`
- Radio filter bound to `filter_Radio_Vendor`
- Range filter bound to `filter_Range_BudgetNumber`
- Sorting filter bound to `filter_Sorting`
- Apply button bound by `search-filter.attrs.apply_t = "2"` and `search-filter.attrs.apply_btn`
- One data table/list-like dashboard control
- Summary controls
- Pie, column, and line chart/report controls

Remove filters is not included in the final runtime package. A candidate `remove-filers` control using the export-proven no-target shape was tried during the session, but it did not surface as a visible runtime control. Keep Remove filters reset behavior export-proven only until a focused generated package proves a stable reset-target/runtime shape.

Hierarchy filter is not included in this runtime package. It remains export-proven from the CRM dashboard learning pass, not runtime-proven.

## Local Validation

Final package validation results:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Generator syntax check | pass |
| Data Filter inspector | pass, 0 errors, 0 warnings |
| Dashboard page inspector | pass |
| Strict package validator | pass with warnings, 0 errors |
| Strict graph validator | pass with warnings, 0 errors |
| App creation rules inspector | pass |
| YAP schema-standard inspector | pass |
| Materialization inspector | pass with warnings, 0 errors |
| Aggregate import-readiness gate | pass with warnings, 0 errors |
| Wrapper round trip / placeholder scan | pass |

Warnings were non-blocking template-backbone warnings, including schema-supported-runtime-unproven field controls and `NO_FORMS` for the dashboard/list-only proof package. The Data Filter-specific inspector reported no unresolved filter variables, no unresolved downstream references, and no missing apply-button reference.

## Runtime Result

Runtime import/open was performed in Yeeflow using the generated package from Downloads.

Observed:

- Package upload parsed app metadata as `Data Filter Runtime Proof`.
- Import completed and the app appeared in the workspace.
- The app opened.
- The `Dashboard` page opened.
- Dashboard summary controls rendered.
- The data table/list-like control rendered rows.
- Chart/report controls rendered: pie, column, and line chart areas were visible.
- Representative Data Filter controls rendered: Search filter, Radio filter, Range filter, Sorting filter, and Apply button.
- No missing filter variable error was observed.
- No missing downstream data binding error was observed.
- No dashboard render crash was observed.

## Interactions Tested

- Click-on-apply interaction: entered `Annual` in the Search filter and clicked `Apply Search`. The dashboard stayed stable and the URL updated with `__filter_filter_Search=Annual`.
- Value-change interaction: selected a Radio filter option (`Party Props & More`). The dashboard stayed stable, the selected value rendered in the control, and chart/table surfaces remained visible.

These interactions prove only basic safe interaction stability for this generated representative dashboard package. They do not prove full filter semantics, every operator, every control type, pagination behavior, performance, or cross-control combination correctness.

## Proof Boundary

- Dashboard Data Filter schemas across Sales and CRM exports: export-proven.
- Help Center behavior: product-documented.
- Generated dashboard package import/open/render/basic interaction: runtime-proven for the representative controls in this package only.
- Search click-apply wiring: runtime-proven for the representative generated package.
- Radio value-change selection stability: runtime-proven for the representative generated package.
- Range and Sorting controls: render-proven in this package; exhaustive interaction semantics not proven.
- Remove filters: not runtime-proven in this package.
- Hierarchy filter: not runtime-proven in this package.
- Approval-form and data-list-form Data Filter usage: not runtime-proven.
- Data mutation, workflow behavior, notifications, permissions/security, and large-data performance: not tested.
