# Advanced Controls Runtime Proof

Runtime status: passed for the focused generated package. The user confirmed that `/Users/Renger/Downloads/advanced-controls-runtime-proof.v1.yap` imported successfully, opened the Advanced Controls Runtime Dashboard, rendered the included advanced controls, and showed no missing binding, render, action, or page-break error.

## Generated Package

- App name: `Advanced Controls Runtime Proof`
- Dashboard: `Advanced Controls Runtime Dashboard`
- Data List: `Advanced Control Runtime Items`
- Data List custom forms: `New Item`, `Edit Item`, `View page`
- Manual-test package path: `/Users/Renger/Downloads/advanced-controls-runtime-proof.v1.yap`
- Local ignored generated package: `advanced-controls-runtime-proof.v1.yap`
- Generator: `generate-advanced-controls-runtime-proof.mjs`

The generated `.yap` package, decoded app data, decoded resource JSON, validation JSON, screenshots, and runtime evidence files are not committed. The committed artifacts are limited to the generator script, this proof doc, safe validator/inspector updates, and skill guidance.

## Controls Included

Dashboard controls:

- Tab: one `aktabs` control with two `ak-tabs-tab` children and nested controls.
- Toggle: one `toggle` control with two `toggle-panel` children and nested controls.
- Timer: one safe static future date under `attrs.set.date`.
- Icon list: two safe static links to Yeeflow-owned public URLs.
- Divider: plain and labeled `line` controls.
- Alert: info, success, warning, and error-style variants.
- Progress bar: static numeric percentage values.
- Spacer: `gap` controls with explicit spacing.
- Progress circle: static percentage values.
- Steps bar: static `steps-options` and static current step.
- QR Code: static `https://www.yeeflow.com` via `attrs["qr-code-link"].customUrl.url`.
- Barcode: static safe values with `CODE128`.
- Embed: iframe with static public `https://www.yeeflow.com` URL.

Data List `View page` controls:

- Steps bar: field-bound to the current item `Stage` radio field (`Text1`).
- QR Code: static `https://www.yeeflow.com` URL.
- Barcode: static safe value.
- Embed: iframe with static public Yeeflow URL.
- Document embed: bound to the current item `Attachment` file-upload field (`Text4`) and expected to render a safe empty state until a safe test file is later added.

## Data List Fields

`Advanced Control Runtime Items` includes only safe synthetic fields and one safe sample row:

- `Title` input
- `Stage` radio (`Plan`, `Build`, `Validate`, `Runtime test`)
- `Progress` percent
- `Link URL` hyperlink
- `Barcode Value` input
- `Attachment` file-upload, empty in sample data

## Local Validation Results

All local validation commands completed with zero errors:

| Check | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `node --check generate-advanced-controls-runtime-proof.mjs` | pass | generator syntax valid |
| `node --check scripts/inspect-advanced-controls.mjs` | pass | inspector syntax valid |
| `node --check validate-yap-package.js` | pass | package validator syntax valid |
| `node validate-yap-package.js advanced-controls-runtime-proof.v1.yap --mode generator --stage final` | pass_with_warnings, 0 errors | warnings are runtime-sensitive field/control support and UI style guidance |
| `node validate-yap-graph.js advanced-controls-runtime-proof.v1.yap --mode generator --stage final` | pass_with_warnings, 0 errors | warnings are runtime-sensitive field support |
| `node scripts/inspect-advanced-controls.mjs advanced-controls-runtime-proof.v1.yap --page "Advanced Controls Runtime Dashboard" --list-form "View page"` | pass, 0 findings | detected 36 advanced controls across dashboard and View page |
| `node scripts/inspect-yap-schema-standard.mjs advanced-controls-runtime-proof.v1.yap` | pass, 0 findings | wrapper/schema standard check passed |
| `node scripts/inspect-app-creation-rules.mjs advanced-controls-runtime-proof.v1.yap` | pass, 0 findings | app creation rule check passed |
| `node scripts/inspect-yap-materialization.mjs advanced-controls-runtime-proof.v1.yap` | pass_with_warnings, 0 errors | warning: no workflow/form resources, expected for this dashboard/list proof |
| `node scripts/inspect-yap-import-readiness.mjs advanced-controls-runtime-proof.v1.yap` | pass_with_warnings, 0 errors | aggregate gate passed; 36 warnings retained as runtime-sensitive notes |
| `node build-yap-wrapper.js .tmp/advanced-controls-runtime-proof.v1.resource.json .tmp/advanced-controls-runtime-proof.roundtrip.yap --title "Advanced Controls Runtime Proof" --description "Focused safe generated package for runtime proof of Yeeflow advanced controls." --validation-mode generator` | pass | wrapper build/round trip passed |
| `git diff --check` | pass | no whitespace errors |

Warnings intentionally retained:

- Percent, hyperlink, file-upload, and several advanced controls remain runtime-sensitive until this generated package is imported and opened.
- The package has no approval/workflow resources by design.
- UI-style warnings do not block this focused proof because the package is a compact control test harness, not a production app shell.

## User Runtime Result

The user confirmed the generated package imported successfully and the `Advanced Controls Runtime Dashboard` opened.

Passed runtime checks:

1. Tab rendered and tab switching worked.
2. Toggle rendered and expand/collapse worked.
3. Timer rendered.
4. Icon list rendered and links appeared.
5. Divider rendered.
6. Alert variants rendered.
7. Progress bar rendered.
8. Spacer created spacing.
9. Progress circle rendered.
10. Steps bar rendered.
11. QR Code rendered.
12. Barcode rendered.
13. Embed rendered safely without breaking the page.
14. Document embed rendered a safe empty state.
15. No missing binding, render, action, or page-break error appeared.

## Manual Runtime Test Instructions

The following checklist is the completed runtime scope for `/Users/Renger/Downloads/advanced-controls-runtime-proof.v1.yap` and can be reused for future retests:

1. The app imports successfully.
2. `Advanced Controls Runtime Dashboard` opens.
3. Tab control renders and tab switching works.
4. Toggle control renders and expand/collapse works.
5. Timer renders using the static future date.
6. Icon list renders and the two safe public links appear.
7. Divider controls render.
8. Alert variants render.
9. Progress bar renders.
10. Spacer creates visible spacing.
11. Progress circle renders.
12. Static Steps bar renders.
13. QR Code renders for `https://www.yeeflow.com`.
14. Barcode renders for safe static values.
15. Embed renders or fails safely without breaking the page.
16. Open `Advanced Control Runtime Items`, open the included sample row, and open `View page` if needed.
17. Field-bound Steps bar renders from the sample row `Stage` value.
18. Document embed renders a safe empty state because `Attachment` is empty. A safe file can be added later to test non-empty preview behavior.
19. No missing binding, render, action, or page-break error appears.

## Proof Boundary

- Runtime proof is limited to `/Users/Renger/Downloads/advanced-controls-runtime-proof.v1.yap`.
- Runtime proof covers rendering and basic interactions for Tab, Toggle, Timer, Icon list, Divider, Alert, Progress bar, Spacer, Progress circle, Steps bar, QR Code, Barcode, Embed safe render, and Document embed empty state.
- Local validation remains a separate readiness gate and is not a substitute for runtime proof on future packages.
- This proof does not claim QR scan behavior.
- This proof does not claim Barcode scan behavior.
- This proof does not claim external iframe content loading beyond safe render.
- This proof does not claim document preview for non-empty files.
- This proof does not claim dynamic value changes.
- This proof does not claim Approval Form/Public Form host behavior because this package does not include those hosts.
