# Kanban Collection Timeline Runtime Proof

## Status

- Runtime status: pending user manual test
- Generated package: `/Users/Renger/Downloads/kanban-collection-timeline-runtime-proof.v1.yap`
- Generator: `generate-kanban-collection-timeline-runtime-proof.mjs`
- App name: `Kanban Collection Timeline Runtime Proof`
- Dashboard: `Dynamic Controls Runtime Dashboard`
- Data List: `Dynamic Control Runtime Items`

This package is a focused generated runtime candidate for the Kanban, Collection, Vertical Timeline, Horizontal Timeline, and Dynamic control patterns learned from `Company Overview.yap` and `Company Overview (1).yap`.

## Package Scope

The package contains:

- One Data List with four safe synthetic rows.
- One dashboard with:
  - Kanban control
  - Collection control
  - Vertical Timeline control (`timeline-v`)
  - Horizontal Timeline control (`timeline-h`)
- All four dashboard controls bind to the same Data List.
- Item templates use Dynamic controls with the learned current-item pattern:
  - `attrs.source = "3"`
  - `attrs["obj-f"] = <field name>`

Fields included:

- `Title` / Item Title: text
- `Text1` / Status: radio/category
- `Datetime1` / Start date: date
- `Decimal1` / Progress: percent/decimal
- `Text2` / Owner: identity-picker
- `Text3` / Cover image: icon-upload
- `Text4` / Reference files: file-upload
- `Text5` / Notes: textarea

The synthetic rows populate text, status, date, progress, and notes. User, image, and file fields are schema-safe but intentionally empty to avoid embedding tenant user IDs or file/image payloads.

## Controls Included

Kanban:

- Type: `kanban`
- Data source: `attrs.data.list`
- Category field: `attrs.data.cateField = "Text1"`
- Item template: `kanban-body` with Dynamic image, field, user, and file controls

Collection:

- Type: `collection`
- Data source: `attrs.data.list`
- Item template: child container with Dynamic image, field, user, and file controls

Vertical Timeline:

- Type: `timeline-v`
- Data source: `attrs.data.list`
- Timeline title expression: `ctx = "__ctx_coll"`, `id = "Title"`
- Sort/date field: `Datetime1`
- Item template: child container with Dynamic image, field, user, and file controls

Horizontal Timeline:

- Type: `timeline-h`
- Data source: `attrs.data.list`
- Timeline title expression: `ctx = "__ctx_coll"`, `id = "Datetime1"`
- Sort/date field: `Datetime1`
- Horizontal settings include columns, card arrows, point size, and slides
- Item template: child container with Dynamic image, field, user, and file controls

- Schema-standard inspector: passed with 0 errors and 0 warnings
- Kanban/Collection Dynamic inspector: passed
  - 1 Kanban
  - 1 Collection
  - 14 dashboard Dynamic controls
- Timeline Dynamic inspector: passed
  - 1 Vertical Timeline
  - 1 Horizontal Timeline
  - 1 same-page Collection
  - 14 timeline Dynamic controls
- Import-readiness: passed with warnings only
- Wrapper decode round trip: passed
- Safety scan: passed

## Manual Test Instructions

Import `/Users/Renger/Downloads/kanban-collection-timeline-runtime-proof.v1.yap` into Yeeflow, then:

1. Open `Kanban Collection Timeline Runtime Proof`.
2. Open `Dynamic Controls Runtime Dashboard`.
3. Confirm the Kanban renders cards grouped by `Status`.
4. Confirm the Collection renders item cards.
5. Confirm the Vertical Timeline renders timeline items.
6. Confirm the Horizontal Timeline renders timeline items.
7. Confirm Dynamic field values display for title, status, date, and progress.
8. Confirm Dynamic user/image/file controls do not crash or show missing-binding errors.
9. If desired, add safe runtime values to Owner, Cover image, and Reference files, then verify Dynamic user/image/file display.

## Proof Boundary

- This package is locally generated and validator-backed, not runtime-proven until user import/testing is complete.
- Runtime proof, once completed, applies only to this generated package and the tested controls/fields.
- Do not claim all Kanban, Collection, Vertical Timeline, or Horizontal Timeline options.
- Do not claim Kanban drag/drop.
- Do not claim click/open behavior unless tested.
- Do not claim image/file preview or download unless tested with safe uploaded runtime values.
- Do not claim Data List form runtime behavior unless separately included and tested.
