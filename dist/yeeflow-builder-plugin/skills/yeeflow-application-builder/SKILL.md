# Yeeflow Application Builder

## Full Application Visual Quality Gate

Vendor Onboarding full UI v2 proved that import/install success is not enough. Do not call a generated package a full UI application unless it implements the approved plan and mockup-derived pages, forms, controls, bindings, and actions at usable quality. Blank or generic Data List custom forms are quality failures. Default/plain buttons without action bindings are quality failures. Default alert copy such as `Alert` or `Here is the description` is a quality failure. Kanban and Collection controls without meaningful dynamic item templates and item actions are quality failures.

For full application generation, run `scripts/inspect-generated-app-quality.mjs --package <package> --spec <approved-spec.md> --strict-visual-app-quality` before handoff. The strict gate must fail missing planned pages/forms, missing print pages, underbuilt dashboards, missing safe padding/card structure, placeholder controls, default buttons, missing actions, empty Kanban/Collection templates, and undocumented deferred scope. Do not return a minimal or technically importable scaffold when the user asked for the full approved application.

Before full application package generation, create a page-by-page composition checklist and get it approved when the app is mockup/spec driven. The checklist must name each required page section, Yeeflow control, source list, displayed fields, layout/card/grid/padding rule, button/action binding, item template, fallback, validation rule, and pass/fail status. Do not generate a package directly from high-level requirements when the user expects a full designed app. The generated package must implement every approved checklist item or explicitly defer it with a reason, fallback, and validation impact. Treat the approved composition checklist as the generation contract; do not generate or return a package unless every required checklist item is implemented or explicitly deferred with reason.


## Template Library Contract

Full application generation must use the reusable Yeeflow UI section template library when one is available. Composition checklist sections must reference a known `templateId` from `docs/templates/yeeflow-ui-section-template-library.normalized.json`, and generated packages must satisfy the referenced template's required controls, data bindings, fields, layout/card/padding rules, style rules, and action rules. Feature knowledge alone is not enough; use reusable UI templates for dashboard headers, KPI cards, alert cards, Data table sections, Kanban/Collection item cards, detail headers, sectioned forms, document checklists, print pages, and action bars.

Generate full applications page by page. Validate each page/form/dashboard against template conformance before assembling or returning a package. Do not satisfy a template with placeholder controls, title-only cards, default alert copy, blank custom forms, or active buttons without valid action bindings. If a template cannot be implemented safely, explicitly defer the section with a reason, fallback, and validation impact before generation.
Use the reference app corpus as the first source of export-proven UI section patterns before inventing new layouts. Prefer safe patterns from `Company Overview (3).yap`, `Data Lists (4).yap`, `Projects Center_2.yap`, and `Sales_Management_AD.yap` for advanced dashboard controls, custom list forms, Kanban/Collection item templates, actions, Data tables, related-record sections, filters, and operational workspaces. Use `DEMO Innovation Ecosystem Platform (1).yap` / `NHIC Innovation Overview` and `Service Desk Pro (2).yap` / `Executive Dashboard` as KPI dashboard references. Use `Online Library.yap` / `Inventory` and `Print Inventory` plus `Online Library (1).yap` / `Print Inventory` as multi-inventory print and per-item QR references. Use `Sales Quotation.yap` and `Sales Quotation (1).yap` as single-item print and print-QR references. For print pages, QR Code should bind to current item/current record or a business code field; do not generate static placeholder QR URLs. A new broad golden app is no longer needed for known template-library gaps, but browser print/page-break and scanned QR destination behavior still need runtime/manual proof.

## Vendor Onboarding v4.1 Hard Checks

Treat the completed Vendor Onboarding v4.1 iteration as a golden generation reference. Future full-app generation must hard-check these rules before handoff: dashboard pages use `Main > Content`; layout-only Grid controls have display caption off; every Navigator control label is meaningful rather than defaults like `Container`, `Grid`, `Text`, `Dynamic field`, or `Kanban`; KPI numeric cards are data-bound through Summary controls, `attrs.save_var`, dashboard `tempVars`, and visible formatted Text controls rather than static numeric Text; active buttons use valid action bindings; dynamic controls are placed only where context supports them, especially inside Kanban/Collection/Timeline item templates; generated data lists include valid schema, visible default display fields, selected lookup display fields, populated choice options, and sample data. Keep the remaining Vendor lookup picker no-record behavior as a known product-team follow-up, not a reason to remove lookup display-field validation.


## Public Tenant Safety

- Never hardcode a tenant-specific Yeeflow URL. Use `https://<yourdomain>.yeeflow.com` in docs and examples.
- For live API calls, prefer `YEEFLOW_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yeeflow.com/v1` and `YEEFLOW_API_KEY`; do not ask users to paste secrets into chat.
- Use `YEEFLOW_TENANT_URL` only for tenant/app links, for example `https://<yourdomain>.yeeflow.com`; never use a tenant URL as the API base.
- Treat `YEEFLOW_BASE_URL` as a legacy API base URL alias only, not as a tenant URL.
- Support `YEEFLOW_PROFILE` where scripts support profiles. It selects one active local tenant profile per run using `YEEFLOW_<PROFILE>_API_KEY`, `YEEFLOW_<PROFILE>_TENANT_URL`, and `YEEFLOW_<PROFILE>_TENANT_ID`.
- Validate and redact environment variables before API calls and never print API keys, raw API responses, tenant IDs, private URLs, raw `Resource`, raw `Sign`, decoded payloads, or generated runtime packages.
- Keep generated examples tenant-neutral unless the user explicitly requests a target-tenant-specific package and provides safe mappings.

## Plan-First Full-Scope Generation

For application-generation requests, create an application plan Markdown file before building a `.yap` or `.yapk` package unless the user explicitly says to skip planning. Save safe plans under `docs/generated-app-plans/<safe-app-name>-plan.md` when the plan is suitable for git. If the plan contains tenant-specific, private, or runtime-generated details that should not be committed, save it outside git and clearly report the path.

For generated YAP root dashboards, use the current dashboard shell learned from the Vendor Onboarding v1.93 export: root `Type = 103`, `LayoutView = null`, `Ext2 = "{\"src\":true}"`, and `LayoutInResources = []` when no inline dashboard resource is present. Current dashboards can include inline `LayoutInResources` content; Vendor Onboarding v1.12 proves a simple current-dashboard Data table can import and render without query errors when columns use `Field` for source bindings and `FieldName` for labels. Keep root navigation pointing to the dashboard `LayoutID`, and preserve the import-learned YAP rules: `AppID = 41`, API-issued IDs, populated `ReplaceIds`, integer `Field.Category`, unique IDs, product-schema `ListExportResult`, and child `CustomType = ListSite_<root ListID>`.

The app plan must cover the application purpose, target users/roles, business process overview, data lists and fields, document libraries when needed, New/Edit/View forms, Print Page when needed, approval forms when needed, dashboards/pages, controls selected for each page, actions/workflows, automation logic, permissions/roles, integration/API needs, layout/design approach, a `UI/UX and Control Mapping` section, validation checklist, assumptions, exclusions/deferred items, and proof boundary.

Ask focused clarification questions before generation when blocking details are missing: app purpose, roles, data lists, important fields, statuses, approval flow, dashboards/reports, required actions/workflows, integrations, package type, or target output. Ask only the minimum needed to avoid a bad package. If uncertainty is not blocking, state assumptions in the plan and proceed.

Do not default to a simple, MVP, basic, or small v1 package. The default is the complete functional application described in the plan, including all core data lists, fields, forms, dashboards, actions, workflows, and major controls that are safe to generate. Staged generation is allowed only when the user requests it, the app is too large for one safe package, critical information is missing and the user accepts assumptions, or the task is explicitly a focused runtime proof package.

After generation, compare the package against the plan. Do not return the final package until planned data lists, important fields, forms, dashboards/pages, major controls, workflows/actions, Data table display columns, padding/layout quality, and required bindings are present or explicitly documented as deferred with a reason and workaround.

## Web App UI/UX To Yeeflow Control Mapping

Design the Yeeflow app like a modern web application first, then map the design to Yeeflow controls. Use the best combination of standard Yeeflow controls, style settings, custom CSS, and Custom code control when needed.

Before selecting controls, understand the business goal, target users/roles, main journeys, data-entry flows, review/approval flows, dashboard/reporting needs, mobile/desktop expectations, what users need to see first, and the actions users perform most often. Decide which pages should be simple, dense, visual, printable, or operational before choosing Yeeflow controls.

Map common web-app patterns deliberately:

- data grid/admin table -> Data table with configured columns, filters, actions, and safe padding
- card list/activity feed -> Collection with Dynamic field/user/image/file controls
- status board/task board -> Kanban with group/category field and item actions
- timeline/history/milestones -> Vertical Timeline or Horizontal Timeline
- multi-section detail page -> Tabs, Toggle, Containers, Grid, Divider, Alert, Steps bar, and Progress controls
- line items/invoice details/purchase items -> Dynamic Sub List with body grid, containers, row actions, and summary settings
- printable record -> Data List custom Print Page with read-only fields and Dynamic Sub List when needed
- process/status visualization -> Steps bar, Progress bar/circle, badges, alerts, and status fields
- quick links/shortcuts -> Icon list or button/card layout
- QR/barcode sharing/scanning -> QR Code and Barcode controls
- embedded report/map/video/page -> Embed control when safe
- attachment/document preview -> Document embed
- highly customized UI -> scoped custom CSS or Custom code control only after standard controls are insufficient

Choose control combinations based on business value, not because a control is easy to generate. Example combinations include dashboard overview with KPI cards, progress circles, alerts, data table/collection, and quick actions; record view with a header summary, tabs for details/history/files, steps bar, line-item sub list, and document embed; approval app with request form, dynamic sub list, approval timeline, print page, and dashboard status board; operations app with Kanban, Collection action buttons, bulk selection, and administrative Data table.

Use Yeeflow styling capabilities intentionally: layout padding, card/container spacing, grid columns, section backgrounds, border radius, shadows/borders where supported, typography hierarchy, status colors, icons, responsive layout, and custom CSS when needed. Generated applications should not look like raw unstyled controls placed on a blank page.

Use custom CSS only when standard style settings are not enough for fixed-width tables, scrollable layouts, spacing/alignment refinement, visual card polish, conditional visual states, print formatting, special sub-list/table layouts, or dashboard grouping. Keep custom CSS minimal, scoped, documented, safe, and never use it to hide broken structure.

Use Custom code control only when standard Yeeflow controls plus style settings/custom CSS cannot meet the requirement. Confirm whether the requirement can be solved with standard controls first, whether custom CSS is enough, whether custom code can be safely embedded and maintained, and what native fallback exists. Do not use custom code as a shortcut for normal Yeeflow controls.

Each app plan must include a `UI/UX and Control Mapping` section. For each page/form/dashboard, list the user goal, chosen layout pattern, selected Yeeflow controls, rationale, data bindings, actions, styling approach, custom CSS/custom code needs, alternatives considered when relevant, and validation checks.

## Visual Design To Implementation Workflow

When the user provides UI mockup images, screenshots, generated design images, wireframes, or asks Codex to design images first, treat those visuals as implementation references, not decoration. Before package generation, extract a Markdown UI implementation spec from the visual design.

Suggested safe path:

```text
docs/generated-app-plans/<safe-app-name>-ui-implementation-spec.md
```

If the spec would include private image references, tenant data, customer names, raw payloads, or private IDs, save it outside git and report the path.

The UI implementation spec should capture pages, sections, layout hierarchy, Yeeflow controls per section, data list bindings, fields displayed, form fields, Data table columns, Collection/Kanban/Timeline item template fields, actions, workflow/form actions, style settings, custom CSS requirements, responsive considerations, print-page formatting, and validation checklist.

Preserve design quality during generation. Do not simplify a rich mockup-backed design into a blank/simple page or minimal app unless the user explicitly asks. Do not omit major pages or visible controls from the mockup. Do not generate Data tables without columns, Collection/Kanban/Timeline controls without meaningful item templates, or forms without safe padding and card/section layout.

After generation, validate against both the app plan and UI implementation spec with `scripts/inspect-generated-app-quality.mjs --package <package> --plan <plan.md> --spec <ui-implementation-spec.md>` when available.

## Generated Application UI Quality Gate

Before package generation, create a short UI plan that names the pages, major sections, data sources, controls per page, fields shown in every data-bound control, and the padding/container approach. Prefer fewer well-configured controls over a broad unfinished dashboard.

Default generated dashboards and Data List custom forms must use safe outer spacing. Use an outer page section/container with desktop left/right padding around 24px to 32px when the schema supports it, with smaller responsive padding for tablet/mobile. Do not place major controls directly against the page or window edge. Group important content in sections, cards, or containers with readable row and section spacing.

Do not generate empty or unconfigured controls. Every generated Data table must configure a data source and at least 3 to 5 meaningful display columns when fields are available, including title/name plus status, date, owner, amount, or progress fields where relevant. Dashboard Data table columns must include `Field` for the actual source field internal name and `FieldName` for the visible label; `FieldName` alone is not enough. If suitable fields are unavailable, use cards, Collection, or a simple message instead. Empty Data table display configuration or missing source `Field` bindings are generated-final hard errors.

Every data-bound control must resolve its source and field bindings before handoff. Collection, Kanban, and Timeline templates need meaningful dynamic fields; progress, steps, QR/barcode, embed, document embed, and buttons/actions need valid values, bindings, or actions. Run the generated UI quality gate together with package validation and do not claim the package is ready when table, dashboard, or form quality checks fail.

Fail the quality review when controls are selected without business rationale, Data tables have no columns, Collection/Kanban/Timeline templates are empty or too minimal, dashboards/forms lack padding or grouping, advanced controls lack meaningful content, Custom code is used where standard controls would be better, or the package does not match the `UI/UX and Control Mapping` plan.

Use this skill when the user provides business requirements, process documents, forms, screenshots, SOPs, sample exports, workflow requirements, or app ideas and asks Codex to build, implement, create, generate, test, or output a Yeeflow application package, `.yap`, or `.yapk`.

YAPK-from-scratch rule: when the requested deliverable is a generated `.yapk`, the builder must still treat the inner application as the first deliverable. Build and validate `AppPackageInfo` content before Brotli/base64/sign. Do not sign if package/app creation validators, graph validators, workflow publish-readiness checks, or placeholder scans fail. `setsign` and `verifysign` prove wrapper/resource integrity, not generated-app correctness or tenant-specific routing. Preserve the proof boundary and write generated `.yapk` output outside git.

YAPK schema v2 rule from Vendor Onboarding v1.13-v1.15: generated `.yapk` output must be `AppExportPackageInfo` with `Resource = base64(Brotli(AppPackageInfo JSON))`. Do not put YAP `ListExportResult` in YAPK `Resource`. Use `Childs[].Fields`, not `Defs`; preserve `LongAsString` fields as strings; emit `PortalInfo: null` when no portal is included; keep `AppID = 41` where the import rules require it; use API-issued IDs for new generated package/object IDs; and validate current-dashboard Data table `Field` bindings before signing.

## YAPK-First Application Delivery Workflow

New Yeeflow application delivery defaults to `.yapk`, not `.yap`. Generate `.yap` only when the user explicitly asks for YAP, when a product-team/debug task is specifically about YAP import, or when a documented fallback requires it. For new apps, build and validate the inner `AppPackageInfo`, then produce a YAPK package for manual install or package-API install.

Before delivery, inspect local environment presence without printing values. If `YEEFLOW_API_KEY` and `YEEFLOW_WORKSPACE_ID` are present, ask whether the user wants automatic installation into the configured workspace; never auto-install without explicit confirmation. For existing app changes, generate a versioned YAPK and use upgrade automation only after the target app/package is clearly identified, safe, and confirmed. Classify package API results as `success`, `already_installed`, `api_rejected`, or `http_rejected`; handle `already_installed` by recommending upgrade flow, cleanup, or a renamed/new-version package rather than retrying blindly.

This skill is the top-level application-building controller. It coordinates proven generator skills:

- `yeeflow-application-generator`
- `yeeflow-data-list-generator`
- `yeeflow-approval-form-generator`
- `yeeflow-dashboard-generator`
- `yeeflow-expression-generator`

Use `yeeflow-feature-learning-orchestrator` instead when the task is primarily to learn an unknown Yeeflow platform feature from exports, screenshots, runtime tests, or manual fixes.

## New Capability Runtime Gate

When a requirement depends on a newly learned or partially understood Yeeflow capability, do not silently fold it into a normal app build as if it were runtime-proven. Use `yeeflow-feature-learning-orchestrator` first for export-backed learning, then make an explicit runtime decision before broad app generation or merge.

For new capabilities, require one of these labels in the plan and final report:

- export-proven only
- validator-backed only
- planning-guidance only
- import-proven only
- configuration-visible only
- render-only proven
- partial runtime proof
- runtime-proven for a specific tested host/scope

Recommend a focused runtime baseline before depending on the capability when generated package behavior, imported rendering, workflow execution, app setting rendering, AI/email/external execution, custom code execution, document upload/persistence, user/group membership, permissions, or row mutation is involved. Keep runtime baselines small and focused; do not use a full business app to prove a new platform schema unless the user explicitly accepts that risk.

## Application Capability Planning Checklist

Before implementation for any full application build, create a `Capability Coverage Plan`. Use `docs/studies/application-planning-capability-coverage.md` when present. The plan should consider the current learned capability set, select only capabilities that serve the business process, mark partial/unproven areas honestly, and assign each selected capability to the right specialized skill before package generation starts.

Cover these planning areas:

- Core resource model: data lists, approval forms, document libraries, dashboards, reports, follow-up/task lists, master/reference lists, transaction lists, and custom forms.
- AI experience: whether the app needs a Copilot, quick prompts, local resource tools, connected Agents, image upload, or attachments.
- AI Agent design: reusable Agents, required input/output variables, image/file inputs, Access application resources tools, create/update/read behavior, email draft/summarization/scoring/recommendation tasks, and human-review boundaries.
- Workflow and automation: data-list workflows, approval workflows, scheduled workflows, triggers, `QueryData`, `AI`/AI Assistant, `MailTask`/Send email, HTTP/API/resource actions, and which execution steps must remain disabled or deferred during runtime tests.
- Document management: document libraries, generated folders, custom document fields/views/forms, and Doc library controls on dashboards or forms.
- Navigation and application shell: default or custom navigation, navigation groups, top-level resources, grouped resources, layout `default`/`left`/`onheader`/`none`, header title visibility, export-proven header height settings, and app user groups.
- Permissions and users: app user groups, role-based experiences, permission-sensitive screens, and the current boundary that user-group member assignment is not export-proven and must not be generated with real users.
- Integrations and connections: HTTP API, OAuth, OpenAPI/REST tools, external calls, post-import connection setup, credential safety, and execution deferral.
- Runtime and validation plan: import-proof target, runtime-proof target, render-only or validation-only areas, validators to run, and artifacts/private data that must never be committed.

For any generated Data List that users will create records in, include a runtime-safe Add form plan. `ListModel.LayoutView.add` must resolve to a generated or export-backed Type `1` custom form layout; `opentype.add` and `modalsize.add` alone are not enough. The focused fixed Container/Button action package is user-confirmed to render the default `+ New item` Add modal for `Action Runtime Requests` after this shape was corrected, but save/data mutation and other hosts remain separate proof items. Validate the default `+ New item` path locally and include manual runtime verification of the Add modal rendering when the app depends on user-created list records.

For requirements that need actionable dashboard cards, Kanban lanes, item edit/delete buttons, selection checkboxes, or bulk update/delete behavior, use `docs/studies/collection-kanban-actions.md`. Collection/Kanban item actions are export-proven as local `attrs.actions[]` on the host control, with item-template controls binding through `attrs.control_action` and current-item context through `__ctx_coll` / `ListDataID`. Plan selected IDs/count as dashboard temp variables, use dynamic display rules for checked/unchecked icons and bulk toolbar visibility, and validate all local action bindings and variable references. Keep actual edit/delete/update/select/bulk execution as a focused runtime-test item unless that specific generated package has been tested.

The focused generated package in `docs/studies/collection-kanban-actions-runtime-proof.md` is the correct-project runtime-proven package for this pattern. It includes one Data List, one dashboard, Collection and Kanban controls, local item actions, current item context, selection state, checked/unchecked icons, selected count, and bulk update/delete actions. Scope the runtime claim to the user-tested v2 package and the tested behaviors only.

Correct-project v2 package: `/Users/Renger/Downloads/collection-kanban-actions-runtime-proof.v2.yap` generated by `generate-collection-kanban-actions-runtime-proof.mjs` imported and passed the user runtime checklist for dashboard open, Collection/Kanban render, Edit item, Delete item, Mark current item as Completed, selection toggle, selected count, bulk toolbar, bulk mark completed, and bulk delete. Do not generalize beyond this package and these actions.

If planning depends on real users, departments, locations, or positions, use `yeeflow-api-operator` only when local credentials are present and the user wants authorized lookup. Do not invent org/reference data when safe API lookup is available, but do not require API access for ordinary package generation. Keep generated packages free of private user data unless explicitly required, narrow in scope, and safe; prefer placeholders, empty app groups, requester/current-user expressions, or post-import configuration.

Every `Capability Coverage Plan` should include:

- selected capabilities
- intentionally excluded capabilities
- deferred or unproven capabilities
- runtime test boundary
- safety boundary
- skill and validator dependencies

Before generation, self-check that the plan considered all available learned capabilities without overusing irrelevant ones, assigned each selected capability to the correct skill, marked proof gaps honestly, and named validation/runtime-test boundaries.

## Application Settings Planning

When requirements mention application navigation, header appearance, menu layout, or app user groups, use the runtime-proven application settings model from the active workspace docs. Generate these settings in the root app `Data.Item.ListModel.LayoutView` JSON string: `sort[]` for menu structure, `attrs["navigator-menu"].position` for layout, and `attrs.appearance` for header fields.

Use `Type = "classes"` for custom navigation groups, keep groups top-level only, keep depth to two layers, require group `Title`, use optional resource `DisplayName` for custom text, omit `DisplayName` for resource-name fallback, and use `Icon: ""` for no-icon. Supported layout values `default`, `left`, `onheader`, and `none` are runtime-proven for generated packages. `attrs.appearance.height = 46` and `hideTitle: true` are runtime-proven together; additional header heights remain unproven. User groups may be generated as empty `Data.AppGroups[]` records with fresh IDs in `ReplaceIds`; do not generate real users, emails, or members until member schema is proven.

## Custom Code Planning

Use custom code as an advanced application component only when the business interaction cannot be delivered cleanly with standard Yeeflow controls, lookup settings, expressions, form actions, workflow actions, or dashboard widgets.

Use custom code when:

- standard Yeeflow controls cannot provide the required interaction
- advanced lookup/picker behavior is needed, such as a reusable search-select component over a large master list
- dynamic UI logic is too complex for standard controls, form actions, lookup filters, or expressions
- a reusable business component already exists and is appropriate for the target app
- the business value justifies the maintenance and runtime-test cost

Avoid custom code when:

- standard controls can solve the requirement
- behavior is simple enough with form actions, lookup, Query data, expressions, dynamic display, or workflow actions
- the script depends on unsupported or unproven runtime APIs
- the app must remain fully no-code for maintainability
- the behavior affects approval routing, financial authority, security, or persistence and can be implemented server/workflow-side

Planning questions before adding a Custom Code control:

- Which page or form needs the component?
- Is the placement a dashboard, approval form, data-list custom form, or public form?
- What inputs does the component need?
- Are inputs static, field-based, variable-based, temp-variable-based, or expression-based?
- Does the component write back to Yeeflow variables, fields, or temp variables?
- Is the component read-only or interactive?
- Is the component safe for public forms and anonymous/limited-permission users?
- What native fallback exists if the component fails?

When an existing script is used in an app package, coordinate with `yeeflow-custom-code-generator` for the script's parameters and with the relevant page/form generator for placement. Do not generate a Custom Code control unless the script is available or generated as part of the app package, required input parameters are configured, and a focused runtime test plan exists.

## Core Behavior

Think like an experienced business consultant and Yeeflow solution architect:

- understand the business goal before designing fields
- identify mandatory core business capabilities before proposing generation scope
- do not defer a feature that is central to the stated business process merely because it is technically sensitive; mark it as a required generation item, required focused runtime proof item, or explicit exclusion with fallback behavior instead
- recommend the best Yeeflow-native application structure
- separate full-scope must-haves from true future enhancements without defaulting to a simple/MVP first package
- separate business decision gates from technical runtime assumptions
- ask the user/business owner to confirm business decision gates before generation, unless they explicitly approve default assumptions
- present unanswered business decision gates directly in the Codex chat and stop before generation until the user answers or explicitly approves defaults
- prefer a working, high-quality app over an overloaded first package
- use proven runtime-safe patterns from the installed skills
- mark unproven features clearly and test them before depending on them
- make reasonable assumptions when requirements are unclear, document them, and keep moving unless the assumption would be risky
- when requirements imply multiple selectable business items, evaluate a sublist/listref design early instead of forcing a single lookup field
- when requirements include requester/applicant/employee identity, decide whether proxy submission is allowed; if the applicant field is editable, its change action must rerun profile snapshot and dependent policy/quota calculations
- when requirements include quota, benefit eligibility, or tenure rules, decide the quota cycle, occupation timing, release behavior, and eligibility source before generation
- every generated data list must have an active runtime purpose in the planned application or be explicitly deferred out of the package
- master/reference data lists named in requirements must be real active generated lists with fields, views, current-standard custom forms, and sample/reference rows when forms, lookups, dashboards, or workflows depend on them; do not leave them as placeholder concepts
- line-item planning must explicitly choose one persistence model: workflow sublist summary only, direct child-row persistence, or a separate transaction item list with its own runtime proof and reporting purpose
- availability, stock, booking, quota, or capacity logic must be labeled honestly as manual review only, query-based availability, or inventory/reservation based; never present review routing as true stock control
- generated dashboards must be meaningful enough for the planned application workflow while staying inside runtime-proven dashboard patterns
- dashboard KPIs, summaries, report sections, queues, analytics, trends, and charts must be implemented with data-bound dashboard controls, not static Text mockups. Use Summary controls for counts/totals, data-list or proven Collection controls for queues/report tables, and chart controls when the chart model is known/proven. Do not remove planned chart controls merely because the initial source list is empty; seed or confirm representative records before deciding chart validity. Use functional list/table fallbacks only for structural chart failures, or as complementary drill-down/reporting views beside working charts
- do not mark dashboard runtime proof as passed only because a page renders; verify source-list bindings, dashboard `exts`, ReportIds, and at least one value/list/empty-state coming from the expected data source
- runtime-unproven features must be marked as required focused proof items or deferred with fallback behavior before final package claims
- workflow routing variables must be required, auto-derived, or protected by fallback branches so no approval path can dead-end on empty/unexpected values
- decide package type before generation: output `.yapk` for a new/cloned application by default, output `.yap` only when explicitly requested or needed for a documented fallback/debug task, and output versioned `.yapk` for an existing-app upgrade from a Yeeflow Version management baseline package
- for `.yapk` upgrades, preserve app identity and stable object IDs; do not apply fresh-ID `.yap` import-generation rules unless adding newly proven resources

## Default Lifecycle

For requirement-to-application requests, load `references/requirement-to-yap-generation-lifecycle.md` and follow it end to end:

1. Requirement intake
2. Initial business analysis
3. Initial app plan/spec Markdown file
4. Business clarification gate
5. Wait for user answers when business-critical decisions are missing
6. Apply confirmed answers to plan/spec and update the saved Markdown plan
7. Generation-readiness review
8. Generate the correct package type only if ready: `.yapk` for new applications by default, `.yap` only when explicitly requested or fallback/debug scoped, and versioned `.yapk` for existing-app upgrades when a safe baseline exists
9. Local validation
10. Runtime import testing when requested or included in the user's build/test request
11. Runtime issue fixing
12. Documentation
13. Skill updates only if new reusable knowledge is learned
14. Git commit/push
15. Final package output

## Package Type Gate

Before generation, clarify whether the user wants:

- a new application package (`.yapk` by default, or `.yap` only when explicitly requested) for import/install as a separate app, or
- an existing application upgrade package (`.yapk`) for Application Settings -> Version management -> Upgrade application.

For new applications, default to the YAPK delivery workflow: fresh generated identity, safe FlowKey/form key, full local app/form/list validation, decoded `AppPackageInfo` validation, and YAPK install as a new app. Use normal `.yap` rules only when the user explicitly requests a `.yap` or the task is a YAP fallback/debug proof.

Materialization hard rules for new `.yap` packages:

- allocate `FieldID` values globally across the app; do not reset per data list
- preserve parent `ListID` on every field
- keep `FieldName`, `InternalName`, and `DisplayName` unique inside each data list
- preserve real `TenantID`, `CreatedBy`, and `ModifiedBy`; do not remap them and do not include them in `ReplaceIds`
- keep all generated numeric-looking IDs within signed `System.Int64` range; Yeeflow import can parse child `LayoutID` as `Int64`, so oversized 20-digit IDs block import
- for generated app-contained AI Agent/Copilot resources, use numeric `Publisher: 0` instead of `Publisher: null`
- for app-contained Access application resources tools, use compact `{ id, permissions }` entries with numeric bitmask permissions, not string arrays
- for data-list workflows, use export-like workflow designer graph metadata so the imported workflow designer can open
- verify root dashboard/page navigation and Type `103` ownership with materialization inspection
- do not runtime-test custom code controls until the imported app opens with real dashboard/list/form content and generated fields are visible

For existing application upgrades, request a baseline `.yapk` downloaded from Yeeflow Version management. Preserve `PackageId`, `TenantID`, `AppID`, `ListID`, stable object IDs, and other app identity fields required for upgrade. Do not generate a `.yap` when the user asked to modify the already-imported app unless they explicitly want a cloned app.

Current `.yapk` limitation: product schema defines the wrapper as `AppExportPackageInfo` and describes `Resource` as Brotli-compressed `AppPackageInfo`, but readable historical artifacts did not verify that Brotli decode path in the current study. For `.yapk` work, use `yeeflow-yapk-package-generator`; the normal `.yap` application generator must not own `.yapk` content generation. Until Yeeflow Resource decode/edit/encode/sign/verify/runtime-upgrade is proven, Codex must not output externally edited app-content `.yapk` packages as valid upgrades; use Yeeflow Version management to generate official `.yapk` packages or produce a `.yap` clone/change plan.

Also load `references/business-solution-design-principles.md` before designing the app structure.
For generation-readiness reviews, also load `references/business-decision-gates.md`, `references/application-design-quality-gates.md`, and `references/application-planning-key-design-decisions.md`.
During final validation and runtime planning, also use the active workspace checklists when present:

- `docs/yeeflow-runtime-test-checklist-template.md`
- `docs/yeeflow-application-generation-review-checklist.md`

## Business Decision Gates

Before generating a real `.yap`, identify business choices that materially change workflow, validation, data persistence, pricing, quota logic, attachment rules, dashboards, or approval responsibility.

Treat these as confirmation gates, not technical notes. Stop before generation if business-critical gates are unanswered and the user has not explicitly approved default assumptions.

### Business Clarification Gate

When unanswered business-critical decisions exist, ask them directly in the Codex chat after the initial app plan/spec is created or updated.

Use this exact chat format:

```text
Business clarification required before generation:

1. <Question>
   - Option A:
   - Option B:
   - Recommended default:
   - Why this matters:

2. <Question>
   - Option A:
   - Option B:
   - Recommended default:
   - Why this matters:

Generation is paused until these questions are answered or defaults are explicitly approved.
```

After outputting this block, do not continue to `.yap` generation in the same turn. Wait for the user's answers or explicit approval of the recommended defaults.

Examples:

- quota cycle policy
- quota occupation/release timing
- mandatory approval roles
- pricing ownership and manual override policy
- exact attachment requirements by scenario
- whether dashboard surfaces belong in the full planned package or a later explicit phase
- status lifecycle
- compliance/audit handling
- integration responsibility
- role permissions
- what happens on approval, rejection, or resubmission

Technical assumptions are different. Token shapes, tenant profile completeness, query-data behavior, conditional ContentList behavior, route-condition behavior, and validator/runtime quirks should be tested during generation/runtime validation and handled with fallback.

App specs should record decision gates using this shape:

```json
"businessDecisionGates": [
  {
    "key": "quotaCycle",
    "question": "Should quota reset by calendar year or employee anniversary year?",
    "options": ["calendarYear", "employeeAnniversaryYear"],
    "recommendedDefault": "calendarYear",
    "requiredBeforeGeneration": true,
    "status": "unanswered"
  }
]
```

## Mandatory Full-Scope Capability Rule

Do not incorrectly move core business capabilities to a later phase. If a capability is essential to the requested business process, keep it in the planned package as either:

- a proven implementation item, or
- a required runtime proof item with a documented fallback.

Only defer true enhancements, integrations, advanced analytics, admin configurability, scheduled automation, or optional polish.

## Design Quality Gate

Before accepting generated approval forms, run a design-quality review using `yeeflow-approval-form-generator`.

Generated app packages must fail readiness if the approval form does not follow the learned Yeeflow design structure:

- page-level background, not `Main` background
- `Main` / `Content` / `Form body` / `Form bottom`
- Form header / request summary
- two-column grids for normal fields
- full-row layout for textarea, upload, list/sublist, rich text, and long helper/guidance content
- learned Text control standard, inline width by default
- meaningful `nv_label`
- Action Panel and Flow History in Form bottom

## Proven Standards To Apply

Use the current Yeeflow generation foundation by default:

- fresh ID family
- fresh FlowKey/form key
- FlowKey/form key must be safe against Yeeflow import replacement: its lowercase text must not appear inside reserved JSON property names such as `prefix`, `suffix`, `field`, `fields`, `profile`, `definition`, `workflow`, `variable`, `filter`, `ref`, `href`, `control`, `collection`, `condition`, `expression`, `attributes`, `actions`, or `binding`. Known failure: FlowKey `EFI` corrupted summary binding key `prefix` into `pr<runtimeFlowKey>x`.
- `Data.Forms[].ListID = 0`
- native Title metadata on generated data lists
- requester/current-user assignment instead of hardcoded tenant users
- page-level background, not `Main` background
- learned Text control standard
- Text controls inline width by default
- Main / Content / Form body / Form bottom
- Action Panel and Flow History in Form bottom
- two-column grids for normal fields
- full-row long controls and sublists
- meaningful `nv_label`
- approval-control runtime coverage
- expression generation rules
- sublist current-object expressions
- sublist summary binding
- workflow numeric routing
- latest workflow transition condition operand wrappers for direct selectors, direct values, and expression-editor operands
- form actions Phase 1 and Phase 2
- correct `attrs.querydata_filters`
- expression-editor token arrays with `showCus: false` for Query data filter values that reference workflow variables or calculations
- `arraySum`
- `JSONStringfy`
- readable lookup summary variables
- multi-item product/service/request lines should use sublists with row calculations and summary-bound total variables when the business process allows multiple selections
- policy-critical totals from sublists should be recalculated in quota/submit/routing/persistence preflight actions with `arraySum(<ListVariableId>, "<SubtotalFieldId>", [], [])`, even when a visible summary binding is present
- applicant/requester variables should be fixed business identities; Current User may default the applicant on a new request, but applicant profile reads, quota checks, workflow routes, and persistence should use the requester/applicant variable or snapshot variables
- editable applicant/requester controls must rerun dependent snapshot/profile/quota form actions on change when proxy submission is allowed
- user-profile-derived applicant data should be snapshotted into workflow/form variables, displayed readonly, and persisted through ContentList when needed for reporting/audit
- quota and benefit usage lists should include applicant identity, readable applicant name, cycle number/year, amount, status, and source application number
- if quota is occupied on submission, create the usage/occupation record when the workflow starts, include in-progress and approved/confirmed records in future quota checks, and release/update the matching record on rejection or final approval using a stored request/form/workflow correlation key
- employee-anniversary quota cycles should use a numeric cycle field when comparing usage records; for boarding-year eligibility, `ApplicantBoardingYears = dateDiff(ApplicantBoardingDate, now(), "year", [])`, with `0` meaning no family quota and values greater than `0` meaning eligible
- configuration lists such as attachment requirement rules must be read by form actions, workflows, dashboards, or reports in v1; otherwise remove/defer them instead of shipping dead configuration
- master data lists such as Equipment Catalog, Visitors, Departments, Products, or Resource Catalog must be generated as usable runtime lists when lookups/forms depend on them; include maintainable sample/reference rows for local validation unless the dependency is deliberately external and mapped
- do not ship generated data lists that only make the app plan look complete; each list must be opened by navigation/dashboard, queried by form actions, written by workflow, or explicitly identified as a maintained master/reference list
- request line items must declare whether they are stored only as a parent readable summary, stored as direct child rows, or stored in a separate transaction item list; direct child-row persistence remains runtime-proof scoped unless a current baseline proves it for the target pattern
- review-only availability decisions may route to an admin/security/equipment reviewer, but they are not inventory control. True stock/availability requires query-backed stock status or reservation/decrement/update behavior with focused runtime proof
- workflow branches from approval/review nodes must cover normal, exception, empty, and unexpected routing-variable cases; unknown policy values should route to review/fallback, not to a dead end
- core policy checks such as quota validation should run automatically on submit, not only through a manual check button
- submit guard actions should prove both the invalid/warning path and the valid path; conditional warning/confirm/check steps before submit usually need step-level `continue: true` so valid requests skip the warning and still reach Submit form
- required applicant identity controls with Default value = Current User should not also get redundant page-load Set variable default steps
- multi-value Set variables should be used only for independent assignments; keep ordered Set variable steps when later values depend on earlier assignments
- temp variables are frontend-only
- ContentList persistence rules

## Stop And Defer

Do not blindly implement every requested detail if it would make the package unsafe, unimportable, or dependent on unavailable tenant data. Defer features only when they are optional, integration-heavy, advanced, unclear, explicitly moved to a later phase by the user, or likely to make the full planned package hard to import and test.

Do not use "runtime-sensitive" alone as a reason to defer a core business capability. For core capabilities, require focused runtime proof and fallback behavior.

Stop before generation when:

- mandatory business decision gates are unanswered
- required full-scope capabilities have been misclassified as future-phase enhancements
- approval form design quality gates are not represented in the plan/spec
- generated form structure lacks grid-based field layout or Form bottom action/history placement

Use `yeeflow-feature-learning-orchestrator` when a requested app needs an unproven platform capability that should be learned from exports before production-style generation.

## Generated App Import-Readiness Handoff

For newly generated `.yap` packages, compatibility validation is not enough. Before final handoff, require strict package validation, strict graph validation, materialization inspection, schema-standard inspection, app-creation rules inspection, data-view/dashboard/page reference checks, wrapper round trip, placeholder scan, and safety scan. Prefer `scripts/inspect-yap-import-readiness.mjs` when available.

The Projects Center fixed package import is user-proven only for the repaired Projects Center package. Do not claim broad app open/use, data entry, document-library upload/folder behavior, report execution, or workflow proof from that incident. Missing `ListType`, unsafe native `Title` metadata, unresolved view columns, mismatched `LayoutInResources` IDs, unresolved dashboard dynamic-display/filter references, and tenant/user metadata in `ReplaceIds` must block generated-package handoff.
<!-- projects-center-import-failure-hardening:end -->

<!-- container-button-action-settings-learning:start -->
## Actionable Dashboard Business Choices

When translating requirements into dashboard actions, choose Container/Button action types by business intent: Link for URL destinations, Add list item for quick-create data/document flows, Open dashboard for navigation and drill-down, Open approval form for starting workflow requests, and form/page Action binding for local front-end logic when the host schema is proven.

Use structural Yeeflow targets instead of raw links for resources included in the generated app. Generated applications must validate Container/Button action targets and open behavior before `.yap` handoff, and runtime navigation/open behavior remains unproven until clicked in a focused runtime test.
<!-- container-button-action-settings-learning:end -->

<!-- sub-list-dynamic-content-learning:start -->
## Sub List Dynamic Content Planning

For business requirements that need repeated line items with a custom row/card/table layout, consider a Sub List with Dynamic content layout before custom code. Approval Form evidence from `docs/studies/sub-list-dynamic-content.md` proves that Dynamic Sub Lists can place visual/layout controls inside each item template, including containers, grids, text/input controls, icons, dropbars, and action buttons.

Plan list actions as Sub List scoped actions: Add sub item and Import items act on the current list; Duplicate item and Delete item act on the current object; Insert before/after current item uses positioned `list_new` steps; Move up/down use `list_move` with Move down carrying `attrs.moveMode = "2"`. For business line-item tables, prefer a visible Delete column plus a row operation menu for Duplicate, Insert before, Insert after, Move up, and Move down. Do not promise runtime execution, save/mutation behavior, current-object expression evaluation, or Data List custom form behavior unless a focused runtime proof covers that exact host and operation.

For runtime follow-up planning, use `generate-sub-list-dynamic-actions-runtime-proof.mjs` and `docs/studies/sub-list-dynamic-actions-runtime-proof.md` as the current minimal candidate: one Approval Form, one Dynamic Sub List, header grid, row fields `Item Name`, `Quantity`, and `Notes`, and actions `list_new`, `list_dup`, `list_del`, and `list_import`. Treat business designs that depend on these actions as pending manual runtime confirmation until the generated package is imported and exercised.

For business table-style line items, prefer the corrected Dynamic Sub List grid pattern over custom code when it fits: one visual section, caption-off header grid, caption-off Dynamic Sub List, matching body grid inside `list-body`, and aligned action/field/icon columns. Treat V1.2 as pending until manual runtime confirms the corrected header/body layout and selected actions.

For quote/invoice/proposal scenarios that need print output, `Sales Quotation.yap` export-proves a Data List `Quotation` custom form named `Print Page` with a read-only Dynamic Sub List for line items and a View form button/action that calls it through a `type = "print"` form action step. Generate print pages as dedicated Type `1` custom forms, bind Dynamic Sub List row displays to a real Sub List field, resolve row fields from `Rules["list-variables"]`, hide edit/add actions on read-only print displays, and keep runtime print execution claims pending until the user tests the print preview.
<!-- sub-list-dynamic-content-learning:end -->

<!-- kanban-collection-dynamic-controls-learning:start -->
## Kanban/Collection Dynamic Controls Planning

For business apps that need grouped work cards, activity collections, or read-only record headers, prefer native Kanban, Collection, and Dynamic controls where the source list and field bindings can be resolved. `Company Overview.yap` export-proves Dashboard Kanban/Collection item templates using Dynamic controls with source `3`, and a Data List `View page` using Dynamic field controls with source `4`.

In plans and final reports, separate export-proven schema from runtime proof. `kanban-collection-timeline-runtime-proof.v1.yap` proves import/open/render stability for the focused generated dashboard package containing Kanban, Collection, Vertical Timeline, Horizontal Timeline, and Dynamic field values. It also proves Dynamic user/image/file controls do not crash with empty values. It does not prove Kanban drag/drop, item click behavior, non-empty dynamic user/image/file display, preview/download behavior, or Data List custom form runtime rendering.

## Timeline Controls Planning

For business apps that need chronological or time-progression views, consider native Vertical Timeline and Horizontal Timeline before custom code. `Company Overview (1).yap` export-proves dashboard `timeline-v` and `timeline-h` controls bound to a Data List and using Dynamic controls inside item templates.

Use Vertical Timeline for activity feeds, history, lifecycle logs, audit/event streams, approval history, and vertical milestone flows. Use Horizontal Timeline for project schedules, roadmaps, lifecycle stages, campaign plans, and phase progression. Timelines should resolve a source list plus date/title/order fields, and item templates should bind Dynamic controls with `attrs.source = "3"` and `attrs["obj-f"]`. A focused generated package has now proven import/open/render stability for timeline controls with Dynamic fields; keep intended interactions, scrolling semantics, preview/download behavior, and non-empty user/image/file display scoped to separate tests.

Runtime proof: `/Users/Renger/Downloads/kanban-collection-timeline-runtime-proof.v1.yap` imported successfully and `Dynamic Controls Runtime Dashboard` opened. Kanban, Collection, Vertical Timeline, Horizontal Timeline, and Dynamic field values rendered; Dynamic user/image/file controls were stable with empty values and no missing binding/render error appeared. User/image/file non-empty display, preview/download, drag/drop, click/open, and Data List form runtime behavior remain unproven.
<!-- kanban-collection-dynamic-controls-learning:end -->

<!-- advanced-controls-learning:start -->
## Advanced Yeeflow Controls Learning

Company Overview (3).yap export-proves advanced Dashboard and Data List custom-form control patterns documented in docs/studies/advanced-controls.md and normalized under docs/studies/normalized/advanced-controls/. Treat this as export-proven and validator-backed only unless a later focused runtime pass proves rendering and interactions.

Planning guidance:

- Use Tab (aktabs / ak-tabs-tab) for multi-tab content grouping when users need related peer views without leaving the page.
- Use Toggle (toggle / toggle-panel) for collapsible multi-section content, FAQ blocks, grouped detail panels, and optional guidance.
- Use Timer for static or dynamic date countdown/deadline indicators such as SLA, due date, campaign, and task timers.
- Use Icon list for quick links, resource shortcuts, and compact navigation lists.
- Use Divider and Spacer for layout structure and visual rhythm between control groups.
- Use Alert for info, success, warning, and error messages where guidance or status communication matters.
- Use Progress bar and Progress circle for numeric progress, completion percentages, KPI capacity, score, and utilization.
- Use Steps bar for phase/status/workflow/approval/onboarding progress; prefer static steps or field-bound single-select/status sources where supported.
- Use QR Code for record/page/form/link sharing and mobile access.
- Use Barcode for encoded record, inventory, ticket, asset, static, or dynamic values.
- Use Embed for iframe/external content such as reports, maps, dashboards, docs, and videos when tenant/security context allows it.
- Use Document embed for attachment/file previews such as contracts, invoices, images, PDFs, Word documents, and PowerPoint decks.

Validation guidance:

- Tab items need valid ids/titles and child control containers.
- Toggle sections need valid ids/titles and child control containers.
- Timer needs a valid static date or dynamic date binding.
- Icon list items should define icon/text/link settings where required.
- Progress bar/circle values must be numeric or resolve to numeric fields/variables.
- Steps bar static steps need valid items; bound sources should resolve to single-select/status fields where applicable.
- QR Code value/URL should be static, dynamic, current-item, current-page, or current-form source; implicit host-current URL behavior remains runtime-sensitive.
- Barcode value must be static or dynamic and barcode type should be supported (CODE128/CODE128A observed).
- Embed code/src/url must be configured and generated-final packages must not contain unsafe placeholder URLs.
- Document embed must bind to attachment/file fields and respect single/multiple settings when configured.
- Generated-final packages should hard-error unresolved required bindings, invalid URLs, incompatible numeric/file/status fields, unsupported barcode types, and unsupported host placement. Historical exports should warn when uncertain.

Proof boundary: Tab and Toggle dashboard usage, Additional-controls dashboard usage, and Company Overview / View page Data List form usage are export-proven only. Approval Form/Public Form support is product-understanding-backed unless separately export-proven. Runtime rendering, link navigation, QR/barcode scan behavior, iframe loading, document preview behavior, and dynamic value changes are not proven in this branch.

<!-- advanced-controls-runtime-proof:start -->
## Advanced Controls Runtime Proof Pattern

Use docs/studies/advanced-controls-runtime-proof.md and generate-advanced-controls-runtime-proof.mjs as the focused generated package pattern for advanced Yeeflow controls. The generated manual-test package is /Users/Renger/Downloads/advanced-controls-runtime-proof.v1.yap and is intentionally uncommitted. The user-confirmed runtime result passed for package import, dashboard open, rendering and basic interactions for the included controls, Embed safe render, Document embed empty state, and absence of missing binding/render/action errors.

Safe minimal generation pattern:

- Generate one compact dashboard named Advanced Controls Runtime Dashboard for Dashboard-host controls.
- Generate one Data List named Advanced Control Runtime Items when current-item bindings are needed.
- Use a View page for Data List form-host controls that are export-proven only on list forms, especially field-bound Steps bar and Document embed.
- Keep sample data synthetic and leave file-upload fields empty when testing Document embed safe empty state.
- Use static public Yeeflow URLs for QR Code and Embed tests; never use private tenant URLs.
- Use static safe Barcode values such as ACR-PROOF-001 and observed-supported barcode types such as CODE128/CODE128A.

Control-specific safe patterns:

- Tab: aktabs with ak-tabs-tab children, titles, one default tab, and nested content controls.
- Toggle: toggle with toggle-panel children, attrs.title.value, and nested controls.
- Timer: timer with attrs.set.date.value using a safe static future date.
- Icon list: icon_list with attrs.data.links[], safe icons, titles, and public links.
- Divider: line with explicit width, line-width, color token, and spacing.
- Alert: alert with attrs.alert.title and attrs.alert.desc; include info/success/warning/error variants when useful.
- Progress bar: progress with attrs.bar.per.value as a static numeric percentage for the runtime baseline.
- Spacer: gap with explicit attrs.space.
- Progress circle: progress-circle with static attrs.per values and common positioning.
- Steps bar: steps-bar with static steps-options on dashboards; on Data List View pages, bind current-step to a current item radio/status field only when the field resolves.
- QR Code: list-qrcode with attrs.qr-code-link.customUrl.url for static URL proof; implicit current URL modes remain host-sensitive.
- Barcode: barcode with attrs.value.value and attrs.type; prefer CODE128 for generated runtime smoke tests.
- Embed: embed with attrs.code containing a safe iframe to a public URL; iframe load success is not guaranteed until runtime-tested.
- Document embed: document-embed with attrs.doc-source bound to a file-upload field; empty-field rendering is a separate proof from non-empty document preview.

User-confirmed runtime result for the focused package:

- The package imported successfully and Advanced Controls Runtime Dashboard opened.
- Tab switching and Toggle expand/collapse worked.
- Timer, Icon list, Divider, Alert variants, Progress bar, Spacer, Progress circle, Steps bar, QR Code, Barcode, Embed, and Document embed rendered in the tested scope.
- Embed rendered safely without breaking the page.
- Document embed rendered a safe empty state.
- No missing binding, render, or action error appeared.

Validation and proof boundaries:

- The local gate should include validate-yap-package, validate-yap-graph, inspect-advanced-controls, inspect-yap-schema-standard, inspect-yap-materialization, inspect-app-creation-rules, inspect-yap-import-readiness, wrapper build/round-trip, git diff --check, and safety scan.
- Zero local validation errors only proves local readiness, not import/open/render behavior.
- Do not claim QR scan behavior, Barcode scan behavior, external iframe content loading, non-empty document preview, dynamic value changes, or Approval Form/Public Form host behavior unless those exact behaviors are tested.
- Keep generated .yap files, decoded payloads, screenshots, and private data out of commits.
