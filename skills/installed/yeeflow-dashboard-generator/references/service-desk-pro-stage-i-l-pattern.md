# Service Desk Pro Stage I-M Pattern

Use this after `service-desk-pro-stage-e-f-pattern.md` when continuing the Service Desk Pro dashboard rebuild beyond static Settings, Help, and Drill-down scaffolds.

## Stage I: Local Support Teams Filter Source

Package: `service-desk-pro-dashboard-stage-i.generated.yap`

Runtime result: imported and opened in Yeeflow. Executive Dashboard rendered a Support Teams select filter and a submitted-period staged control. The local `Support Teams` list opened and rendered rows.

Rules:

- add `Support Teams` as a local child data list before binding the select filter
- preserve native `Title` metadata for the list
- use local rows for first filter-source proof
- keep submitted-period date filtering unbound until date semantics are isolated

## Stage J: Opendashboard Modal Action

Package: `service-desk-pro-dashboard-stage-j.generated.yap`

Runtime result: imported and opened in Yeeflow. Clicking the Executive Dashboard `Drill-down Tickets List` card opened the included Type `103` Drill-down page in a modal.

Rules:

- include the target Type `103` page before adding an action
- attach the action through the clickable control's `attrs.control_action`
- use `type: "opendashboard"` with `attrs.data.page.PageID` pointing to the local dashboard layout id
- graph validation should report a `dashboardActionPage` edge
- query params may appear in the URL, but do not claim temp-variable mapping until separately proven

## Stage K: Bound Drill-down Data-list

Package: `service-desk-pro-dashboard-stage-k.generated.yap`

Runtime result: imported and opened in Yeeflow. Direct navigation and modal launch both rendered the dashboard `data-list` table bound to local `Support Tickets`.

Rules:

- replace static drill-down rows with a dashboard `data-list` control only after the target list is already proven
- `attrs.data.list.AppID`, `ListID`, `ListSetID`, and `Type` must resolve to the local source list
- `attrs.listarr[].Field` must resolve to fields in the local list
- start with `attrs.data.filter: []`

## Stage L: Static Drill-down Filter

Package: `service-desk-pro-dashboard-stage-l.generated.yap`

Runtime result: imported and opened in Yeeflow. Drill-down table rendered only high-priority rows `T-1001` and `T-1006`.

Proven static filter:

```json
{
  "pre": "and",
  "left": "Text2",
  "op": "0",
  "right": "High",
  "showCus": true
}
```

Rules:

- prove static scalar `attrs.data.filter` before variable-driven filter expressions
- keep the filter field name aligned with the generated local list field, not the original export field if the local model differs
- for the current Support Tickets model, priority is `Text2`

## Stage M: Submitted-period Binding and Page Polish

Package: `service-desk-pro-dashboard-stage-m.generated.yap`

Runtime result: imported and opened in Yeeflow. Executive Dashboard rendered the four KPI cards and submitted-period control; clicking `Today` changed the four KPI values from `6`, `2`, `4`, `0` to `0`, `0`, `0`, `0`. Settings rendered 3-column card grids with wider spacing. Help Guide rendered improved static card-grid sections. Support Tickets and Support Teams lists opened without visible query failures.

Proven submitted-period condition:

```json
{
  "pre": "and",
  "left": "Datetime1",
  "op": "0",
  "right": [
    {
      "exprType": "variable",
      "valueType": "string",
      "id": "__filter_f_SubmittedPeriod",
      "type": "expr",
      "name": "f_SubmittedPeriod"
    }
  ],
  "showCus": false
}
```

Rules:

- apply the submitted-period condition to each relevant local Support Tickets `summary` and chart `exts`
- for the current generated Support Tickets model, the submitted date field is `Datetime1`
- the filter variable id is `__filter_f_SubmittedPeriod`; the variable name is `f_SubmittedPeriod`
- each target binding should have exactly one submitted-period condition
- Settings grids are safe with three columns and `24px` column and row gaps
- Help Guide page polish is safe as static cards, but links/actions remain excluded until target resources are proven
- update visible helper copy when a formerly staged filter becomes active

## Remaining Stop Conditions

Stop before generation if:

- query-param to `tempVars` mapping is required but has not been isolated
- original collection card layout must be copied without a successful local baseline
- Settings tile targets external `ListSetID` or `ProcKey` dependencies
- SLA report resources are required but the report definitions and source lists are not included
